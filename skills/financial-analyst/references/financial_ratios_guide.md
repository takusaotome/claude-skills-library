## 1. Profitability Ratios

Profitability ratios measure a company's ability to generate earnings relative to its revenue, assets, or equity.

### 1.1 Return on Equity (ROE)

**Formula:**
```
ROE = Net Income / Total Shareholders' Equity × 100%
```

**Interpretation:**
| Range | Assessment | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| >20% | Excellent | Highly efficient use of shareholder capital |
| 15-20% | Good | Strong returns, industry-competitive |
| 10-15% | Acceptable | Moderate performance |
| <10% | Weak | Below average, may indicate inefficiency |

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- Technology: 15-25%
- Banking: 10-15%
- Retail: 12-18%
- Manufacturing: 10-15%
- Utilities: 8-12%

**Key Considerations:**
- High debt can artificially inflate ROE (leverage effect)
- Compare against industry peers for meaningful context
- Consistent ROE over multiple periods is more meaningful than a single snapshot

### 1.2 Return on Assets (ROA)

**Formula:**
```
ROA = Net Income / Total Assets × 100%
```

**Interpretation:**
| Range | Assessment | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| >10% | Excellent | Very efficient asset utilization |
| 5-10% | Good | Healthy asset productivity |
| 3-5% | Acceptable | Adequate but room for improvement |
| <3% | Weak | Inefficient asset use |

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- Technology: 8-15%
- Banking: 1-2% (due to asset-heavy nature)
- Retail: 5-10%
- Manufacturing: 4-8%

---

### 1.3 Gross Profit Margin

**Formula:**
```
Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue × 100%
```

**Interpretation:**
| Range | Assessment | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| >50% | Excellent | Strong pricing power or low production costs |
| 30-50% | Good | Healthy margins |
| 20-30% | Acceptable | Moderate, typical for competitive industries |
| <20% | Weak | Thin margins, vulnerable to cost increases |

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- Software/SaaS: 70-90%

```
Net Margin = Net Income / Revenue × 100%
```

**Interpretation:**

## 2. Liquidity/Safety Ratios

Liquidity ratios measure a company's ability to meet short-term obligations.

### 2.1 Current Ratio

**Formula:**
```
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
```

**Interpretation:**
| Range | Assessment | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| >2.0 | Excellent | Strong liquidity position |
| 1.5-2.0 | Good | Adequate short-term coverage |
| 1.0-1.5 | Acceptable | May face short-term pressure |
| <1.0 | Weak | Potential liquidity problems |

**Key Considerations:**
- Ratio too high (>3.0) may indicate inefficient use of assets
- Industry context matters (retail typically operates with lower ratios)
- Consider the quality of current assets (collectability of receivables)

---

### 2.2 Quick Ratio (Acid Test)

**Formula:**
```
Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
```

**Interpretation:**
| Range | Assessment | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| >1.5 | Excellent | Strong immediate liquidity |
| 1.0-1.5 | Good | Adequate liquid coverage |
| 0.5-1.0 | Acceptable | Some reliance on inventory conversion |
| <0.5 | Weak | Significant liquidity risk |

---

### 2.3 Debt-to-Equity Ratio

**Formula:**
```
D/E = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity
```

**Interpretation:**
| Range | Assessment | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| <0.5 | Conservative | Low leverage, low risk |
| 0.5-1.0 | Moderate | Balanced capital structure |
| 1.0-2.0 | Aggressive | Higher leverage, higher risk |
| >2.0 | High Risk | Heavily leveraged, potential distress |

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- Utilities: 1.0-2.0 (capital intensive, stable cash flows)
- Technology: 0.2-0.5 (typically low debt)
- Banking: 5-10 (inherent to business model)
- Manufacturing: 0.5-1.0

## 3. Efficiency Ratios

Efficiency ratios measure how effectively a company utilizes its assets.

### 3.1 Asset Turnover

**Formula:**
```
Asset Turnover = Revenue / Total Assets
```

```

---

### 3.4 Working Capital Turnover

**Formula:**
```
Working Capital Turnover = Revenue / (Current Assets - Current Liabilities)
```

**Interpretation:**
Higher values indicate more efficient use of working capital to generate sales.

---

## 4. DuPont Analysis

DuPont analysis breaks down ROE into component parts:

```
ROE = Net Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier

Where:
- Net Margin = Net Income / Revenue (Profitability)
- Asset Turnover = Revenue / Assets (Efficiency)
- Equity Multiplier = Assets / Equity (Leverage)
```

This decomposition helps identify whether ROE is driven by:
1. High profit margins
2. Efficient asset use
3. Financial leverage

## 5. Common Pitfalls

1. **Comparing across industries** - Different industries have different norms
2. **Ignoring trends** - Single-point ratios miss directional changes
3. **Not adjusting for seasonality** - Some ratios fluctuate within the year
4. **Using book values only** - Market values may be more relevant
5. **Ignoring off-balance sheet items** - Operating leases, contingencies
6. **Cherry-picking periods** - Use consistent time periods

---

## 6. Best Practices

1. **Use multiple ratios** - No single ratio tells the complete story
2. **Compare to peers** - Industry benchmarks provide context
3. **Analyze trends** - Look at 3-5 years of history
4. **Consider qualitative factors** - Management quality, market position
5. **Adjust for accounting differences** - GAAP vs IFRS considerations
6. **Document assumptions** - Be transparent about methodology
