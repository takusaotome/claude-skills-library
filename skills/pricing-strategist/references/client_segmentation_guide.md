## 2. Enterprise Segment

### Characteristics

## 3. Mid-Market Segment

### Characteristics

| Attribute | Typical Mid-Market |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Decision Process** | Small committee, less formal |
| **Timeline** | 3-6 months sales cycle |
| **Budget Authority** | Often single decision maker + CFO |
| **Key Buyers** | IT Director, COO, Owner |
| **Evaluation Criteria** | Value, ease of use, support |
| **Price Sensitivity** | Moderate |
| **Relationship** | Shared account management |

### Pricing Strategies

#### Standardized Tiers with Flexibility
```
Tier Structure:
├── Growth: $X,000/month
│   ├── Features: Core + integration
│   ├── Users: Up to 100
│   └── Support: Business hours
│
├── Scale: $X,000/month
│   ├── Features: Above + analytics
│   ├── Users: Up to 500
│   └── Support: Extended hours
│
└── Enterprise Lite: $X,000/month
    ├── Features: Full suite
    ├── Users: Up to 1,000
    └── Support: 24/7

Customization:
├── Additional users: +$XX/user
├── Add-on modules: Priced separately

```

#### Self-Service Plus Sales Assist
- Online pricing transparency
- Sales involvement for larger deals
- Structured discount authority

### Key Considerations

1. **Efficiency Focus**: Can't afford enterprise-level sales touch
2. **Growth Potential**: Today's mid-market = tomorrow's enterprise
3. **Reference Value**: Often more willing to be references
4. **Decision Speed**: Faster than enterprise, but thorough

## 5. Public Sector / Government

### Characteristics

| Attribute | Typical Public Sector |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Decision Process** | Formal procurement, RFP/RFQ |

| **Key Buyers** | Procurement, IT, Agency heads |
| **Evaluation Criteria** | Compliance, best value, past performance |
| **Price Sensitivity** | Budget-constrained but not lowest-price |
| **Relationship** | Formal, documented |

### Pricing Considerations

#### Contract Vehicles
```
GSA Schedule:

├── Discount off commercial pricing
├── Volume discounts built in
└── Streamlined procurement

GWAC/BPA:
├── Task order-based
├── Pre-approved vendors
├── Faster procurement
└── May have ceiling rates
```

#### Compliance Requirements
- Labor category rate ceilings
- Certified cost/pricing data
- Small business set-asides
- Security clearance costs

#### Pricing Structure
```
Example GSA Schedule Pricing:
| Labor Category | Commercial | GSA Rate |
|----------------|------------|----------|
| Sr. Consultant | $250/hr | $210/hr |
| Consultant | $175/hr | $150/hr |
| Analyst | $125/hr | $105/hr |

Volume Discount Schedule:
| Order Size | Discount |
|------------|----------|
| < $100K | 0% |
| $100K - $500K | 3% |
| $500K - $1M | 5% |
| > $1M | 8% |
```

### Key Considerations

1. **Budget Cycles**: Q4 spend-or-lose
2. **Multi-Year Funding**: When available, lock in
3. **Best Value**: Not always lowest price
4. **Past Performance**: Affects future wins
5. **Compliance Cost**: Build into pricing

## 6. Segment-Specific Pricing Matrix

### Summary Comparison

| Dimension | Enterprise | Mid-Market | SMB | Public Sector |
|-----------|------------|------------|-----|---------------|
| **Sales Model** | High-touch | Sales-assisted | Self-service | Formal bid |
| **Pricing Model** | Custom | Tiered | Simple packages | Contracted |
| **Discount Range** | 20-40% | 10-25% | 0-10% | Per contract |

### Price Elasticity by Segment

|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Enterprise | -0.3 to -0.6 | Inelastic, value-driven |
| Mid-Market | -0.8 to -1.2 | Moderate sensitivity |
| SMB | -1.5 to -2.5 | Highly price sensitive |
| Public Sector | -0.4 to -0.7 | Budget-constrained, not elastic |

---

## 7. Segmentation Implementation

### Customer Data Required

| Data Point | Segmentation Use |
|------------|------------------|
| Employee count | Size classification |
| Revenue | Size/budget proxy |
| Industry (NAICS/SIC) | Vertical segmentation |
| Location | Geographic pricing |
| Technology stack | Maturity assessment |
| Purchase history | Behavior patterns |

### Scoring Model Example

```
Segment Score = (Size Score × 0.4) + (Industry Score × 0.2) +
                (Behavior Score × 0.2) + (Potential Score × 0.2)

Size Score:
- Enterprise (5000+): 100
- Large MM (1000-4999): 75
- Mid-Market (250-999): 50
- SMB (50-249): 25
- Micro (<50): 10

Final Classification:
- Score 80+: Enterprise treatment
- Score 50-79: Mid-Market treatment
- Score <50: SMB/Self-service treatment
```

### Treatment Rules

```
If Segment = Enterprise:
  ├── Assign dedicated account manager
  ├── Enable custom pricing authority
  ├── Allow contract customization
  └── Provide white-glove onboarding

If Segment = Mid-Market:
  ├── Assign shared account coverage
  ├── Offer tiered pricing with flexibility
  ├── Provide implementation packages
  └── Enable sales-assisted purchasing

If Segment = SMB:
  ├── Direct to self-service
  ├── Show transparent pricing
  ├── Offer online purchase
  └── Provide automated onboarding
```

---

## 8. Migration Between Segments

### Upsell Triggers

**SMB → Mid-Market:**
- Employee growth past threshold
- Usage/spending increase
- Feature requests beyond tier
- Support escalation patterns

**Mid-Market → Enterprise:**
- Multi-location expansion
- Enterprise feature needs (SSO, compliance)
- Volume growth
- Strategic importance signals

### Pricing Transition

```
Scenario: Customer growing from SMB to Mid-Market

Current: SMB Package at $199/month

Transition Options:
1. Grandfathered rate for 12 months, then market rate
2. Immediate upgrade with 20% loyalty discount
3. Gradual step-up over 3 renewals

Communication:
- Position as "graduation" to premium tier
- Highlight new benefits/features
- Provide dedicated account contact
- Offer implementation assistance
```

## 9. Best Practices

### Do's

1. **Define clear boundaries**: Avoid ambiguity in segment definitions
2. **Align sales compensation**: Incent appropriate segment coverage
3. **Automate routing**: Use scoring for consistent treatment
4. **Review regularly**: Re-evaluate segment membership annually
5. **Track migration**: Monitor customer movement between segments

### Don'ts

1. **Over-segment**: Too many segments = complexity
2. **Ignore outliers**: Large SMB may deserve mid-market treatment
3. **Static classification**: Segments evolve with business
4. **One-size pricing**: Same price destroys value or margin
5. **Ignore behavior**: Size isn't everything; behavior matters
