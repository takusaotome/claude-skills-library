# Contract Review Methodology

This guide provides a comprehensive methodology for conducting contract reviews, from initial receipt to final recommendation.

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose of Contract Review

Contract review serves to:
- Identify unfavorable terms before commitment
- Quantify and prioritize business risks
- Prepare for effective negotiation
- Ensure compliance with policies and regulations
- Document decisions for governance

### 1.2 Key Principles

1. **Business Focus**: Review from business risk perspective, not just legal compliance
2. **Risk-Based**: Allocate effort proportional to risk and value
3. **Systematic**: Use consistent methodology for all reviews
4. **Documented**: Maintain audit trail of findings and decisions
5. **Collaborative**: Involve appropriate stakeholders

## 2. Pre-Review Preparation

### 2.1 Information Gathering

Before starting the review, gather:

**Contract Information**:
- [ ] Complete contract document (all pages, exhibits, schedules)
- [ ] Previous versions or redlines (if negotiating)
- [ ] Related agreements (referenced documents, prior contracts)

**Business Context**:
- [ ] Business owner/sponsor
- [ ] Purpose and objectives of the engagement
- [ ] Contract value and term
- [ ] Strategic importance (high/medium/low)
- [ ] Timeline and urgency

**Counterparty Information**:
- [ ] Company background
- [ ] Existing relationship (if any)
- [ ] Reputation and financial stability
- [ ] Previous contract history

### 2.2 Review Depth Determination

Use this matrix to determine review depth:

| Factor | Quick Review | Standard Review | Deep Review |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Contract value | <$50K | $50K-$500K | >$500K |
| Term length | <1 year | 1-3 years | >3 years |
| Strategic importance | Low | Medium | High |
| Counterparty risk | Low (known vendor) | Medium | High (new/unknown) |
| Data sensitivity | None | Moderate | High (PII, PHI) |
| Customization | Standard terms | Some custom | Highly custom |

**Scoring**: Assign 1 point for Quick, 2 for Standard, 3 for Deep characteristics.
- 6-9 points: Quick Review
- 10-14 points: Standard Review
- 15-18 points: Deep Review

### 2.3 Estimated Effort

| Review Depth | Initial Review | Analysis | Negotiation Prep | Total |
|--------------|---------------|----------|------------------|-------|
| Quick | 30 min | 1-2 hours | 30 min | 2-3 hours |
| Standard | 1 hour | 2-4 hours | 1-2 hours | 4-7 hours |
| Deep | 2 hours | 4-8 hours | 2-4 hours | 8-14 hours |

## 3. Review Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Triage (15-30 minutes)

**Objective**: Quick assessment to identify major concerns and confirm review depth.

**Steps**:

1. **Document Inventory**
   - Verify all pages present
   - Identify all exhibits and schedules
   - Note order of precedence clause

2. **Basic Information Extraction**
   - Parties (legal names)
   - Effective date and term
   - Contract value
   - Key dates (notice periods, renewal)

3. **Quick Red Flag Scan**
   - Review table of contents / section headings
   - Jump to Limitation of Liability
   - Check Indemnification
   - Review Termination
   - Note Governing Law

4. **Confirm Review Depth**
   - Adjust based on initial findings
   - If multiple red flags, escalate to Deep Review

**Output**: Triage summary with review depth recommendation

---

### Phase 2: Detailed Analysis (1-8 hours)

**Objective**: Systematic clause-by-clause review.

**Steps**:

1. **Sequential Read**
   - Read contract from beginning to end
   - Note questions and concerns as you go
   - Mark sections requiring deeper analysis

2. **Clause-by-Clause Analysis**

   For each major clause:
   - Identify the clause purpose
   - Assess balance (mutual vs. one-sided)
   - Compare to market standard
   - Evaluate risk exposure
   - Note any ambiguity
   - Check cross-references

3. **Cross-Reference Check**
   - Verify defined terms used consistently
   - Check exhibit/schedule references
   - Confirm dates and timelines align
   - Verify party names consistent

4. **Contract-Type Specific Review**
   - Apply type-specific checklist (NDA, MSA, SOW, SLA, License)
   - Reference clause_analysis_guide.md

5. **Documentation**
   - Record all findings in standard format
   - Assign preliminary severity
   - Note location (section/page)
   - Capture exact clause text

**Output**: Findings list with severity ratings

---

### Phase 3: Risk Assessment (30-60 minutes)

**Objective**: Quantify and prioritize risks.

**Steps**:

1. **Individual Finding Scoring**
   - Assign Likelihood (1-5)
   - Assign Impact (1-5)
   - Calculate Risk Score (L × I)

2. **Risk Categorization**
   - Financial
   - Operational
   - Legal
   - Strategic
   - Reputational

3. **Overall Score Calculation**
   - Apply severity weights
   - Calculate overall contract risk score
   - Determine risk level (Low/Moderate/High/Critical)

4. **Risk Prioritization**
   - Rank findings by risk score
   - Identify top 10 risks
   - Note any compounding risks

**Output**: Risk matrix, scored findings, overall risk score

---

### Phase 4: Negotiation Preparation (30 min - 2 hours)

**Objective**: Develop negotiation strategy and alternatives.

**Steps**:

1. **Finding Categorization**
   - Deal Breakers (must change)
   - High Priority (should change)
   - Nice to Have (could change)
   - Accept As-Is

2. **Alternative Language**
   - Prepare preferred revision for each negotiation item
   - Prepare fallback position
   - Define minimum acceptable terms

3. **Leverage Assessment**
   - Contract value to counterparty
   - Competitive alternatives
   - Urgency for each party
   - Relationship dynamics

4. **Strategy Development**
   - Prioritized request list
   - Opening vs. minimum positions
   - Trade-off options (give X to get Y)
   - Anticipated pushback responses

**Output**: Negotiation summary with prioritized requests

---

### Phase 5: Reporting (30 minutes)

**Objective**: Compile findings into actionable report.

**Steps**:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - 1-page overview
   - Overall risk assessment
   - Key findings (top 3-5)
   - Recommendation

2. **Detailed Findings**
   - All findings by severity
   - Clause references
   - Risk analysis
   - Recommendations

3. **Risk Summary**
   - Risk matrix
   - Category breakdown
   - Overall score

4. **Negotiation Guidance**
   - Prioritized requests
   - Alternative language
   - Strategy recommendations

5. **Recommendation**
   - Approve / Conditional Approve / Reject
   - Required changes (if conditional)
   - Next steps

**Output**: Comprehensive review report
