# Negotiation Strategies

This guide provides negotiation tactics, alternative language, and strategies for improving contract terms.

## 1. Negotiation Principles

### 1.1 Core Principles

1. **Mutual Value Creation**: Look for win-win solutions
2. **Interest-Based**: Focus on underlying interests, not just positions
3. **Fact-Based**: Support requests with market data and rationale
4. **Prioritized**: Know what matters most; be willing to trade
5. **Professional**: Maintain relationship throughout

### 1.2 Negotiation Preparation Checklist

- [ ] All findings categorized (Deal Breaker / High / Nice to Have / Accept)
- [ ] Alternative language prepared for each request
- [ ] BATNA identified (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement)
- [ ] Walk-away points defined
- [ ] Leverage points identified
- [ ] Trade-off options mapped
- [ ] Approval authority confirmed

## 2. Prioritization Framework

### 2.1 Four-Tier Categorization

| Category | Definition | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **Deal Breakers** | Cannot sign without change | Must achieve or walk away |
| **High Priority** | Significant risk; strongly prefer change | Negotiate hard; escalate if needed |
| **Nice to Have** | Would improve terms | Request; accept if not achieved |
| **Accept As-Is** | Standard or acceptable | No action needed |

### 2.2 Prioritization Criteria

Factors for prioritization:
- Risk score (from risk assessment)
- Financial exposure
- Likelihood of occurrence
- Precedent implications
- Operational impact

### 2.3 Common Deal Breakers

| Issue | Why It's a Deal Breaker |
|-------|------------------------|
| Unlimited liability | Existential risk to company |
| Broad IP assignment | Loss of core assets |
| No termination right | Trapped in bad deal |
| Hostile jurisdiction | Cannot enforce rights |
| Regulatory non-compliance | Legal liability |

---

## 3. Leverage Assessment

### 3.1 Leverage Factors

| Factor | Your Leverage | Their Leverage |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Contract Value** | Large deal = more power | Small deal = take it or leave it |
| **Alternatives** | Many options | Sole source |
| **Urgency** | Flexible timeline | Time pressure |
| **Relationship** | New customer they want | Existing dependency |
| **Expertise** | Unique capability | Commodity |
| **Market Position** | Strong brand/reputation | Dominant vendor |

### 3.2 Strengthening Your Position

Actions to improve leverage:
- Identify competitive alternatives
- Extend timeline if possible
- Involve senior stakeholders
- Reference precedent (other vendors, prior deals)
- Cite industry standards

## 4. Alternative Language Library

AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL EXCEED THE GREATER OF
(A) THE FEES PAID OR PAYABLE DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING
THE CLAIM, OR (B) [DOLLAR AMOUNT].

defend, and hold harmless the other party from and against any third-party
claims arising from: (a) the Indemnifying Party's breach of this Agreement;

any claims that the Services infringe any third-party intellectual property
rights.

at least sixty (60) days before the end of each term.
```

for any reason upon ninety (90) days' prior written notice to the other
party. Upon such termination, Customer shall pay for all Services rendered

```
AMENDMENT. No amendment, modification, or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement shall be effective unless set forth in a written
instrument signed by authorized representatives of both parties.
```

**Fallback Position**:
```
AMENDMENT. Provider may update operational policies and security
practices without Customer consent, provided such updates do not
materially diminish the Services. Any material changes to these terms

```
SERVICE CREDITS. If Provider fails to meet the SLA, Customer shall

- 99.0% - 98.0%: 50% credit
- Below 98.0%: 100% credit

If Provider fails to meet 99.0% availability for three (3) consecutive
months, Customer may terminate without penalty. Service credits are
in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies available to
Customer.
```

## 5. Negotiation Tactics

### 5.1 Opening Strategies

| Strategy | When to Use | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Anchor High** | Strong leverage | "We need liability capped at 6 months fees" (then settle at 12) |
| **Reference Standards** | Market-based request | "Industry standard is mutual indemnification" |
| **Bundle Requests** | Multiple changes | "We have 8 points to discuss" (helps trade-offs) |
| **Provide Rationale** | Educating counterparty | "Our policy requires X because..." |

### 5.2 Response Strategies

| Their Move | Your Response |
|------------|---------------|
| "This is our standard template" | "We understand, but our requirements differ" |
| "We can't change that" | "Help me understand why - what's the concern?" |
| "Everyone signs this" | "What accommodations have you made for others?" |
| "We need to check with legal" | "Understood - when can we reconnect?" |
| "Take it or leave it" | "Let me discuss with my stakeholders" |

### 5.3 Trade-Off Strategies

Map potential trades:

| We Want | We Could Give |
|---------|---------------|
| Lower liability cap | Longer term commitment |
| Mutual indemnification | Limit scope of indemnity |
| Shorter notice period | Smaller termination fee |
| Price cap on increases | Multi-year commitment |
| Better SLA credits | Remove termination for convenience |

### 5.4 Escalation Tactics

When and how to escalate:
1. First: Commercial contact to commercial contact
2. Second: Request involvement of their counsel
3. Third: Involve senior business leadership
4. Fourth: Executive escalation
5. Final: Walk away / consider alternatives

## 6. Common Counterarguments and Responses

### 6.1 Liability Issues

| Their Argument | Your Response |
|----------------|---------------|
| "Unlimited liability is our policy" | "That's unusual in the market; most vendors cap at 12-24 months fees" |
| "The cap is too low" | "Let's discuss a super cap for specific carve-outs like IP and confidentiality" |
| "We can't cap indemnification" | "A cap protects both parties and aligns incentives" |

### 6.2 Termination Issues

| Their Argument | Your Response |
|----------------|---------------|
| "We need the full term commitment" | "We're committed but need flexibility for business changes" |
| "The penalty is standard" | "A declining penalty (75%/50%/25%) is more reasonable" |
| "No one gets termination for convenience" | "Then let's add specific termination triggers (performance, material breach)" |

### 6.3 Data/IP Issues

| Their Argument | Your Response |
|----------------|---------------|
| "We need rights to your data for improvement" | "Aggregated, anonymized data only, with strict limitations" |
| "All IP stays with us" | "Custom deliverables should transfer; we'll license your tools" |
| "We can't commit to specific security" | "Then we need audit rights and breach notification" |
