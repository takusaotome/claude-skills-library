## 4. Financial Analysis

### Cash Flow Analysis

| Year | Initial Investment | Annual Benefits | Operating Costs | Net CF | Cumulative CF |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|---------------|
| Year 0 | -$[XX] | - | - | -$[XX] | -$[XX] |
| Year 1 | - | $[XX] | -$[XX] | $[XX] | -$[XX] |
| Year 2 | - | $[XX] | -$[XX] | $[XX] | $[XX] |
| Year 3 | - | $[XX] | -$[XX] | $[XX] | $[XX] |
| Year 4 | - | $[XX] | -$[XX] | $[XX] | $[XX] |
| Year 5 | - | $[XX] | -$[XX] | $[XX] | $[XX] |

### ROI Calculation

```
5-Year Total Benefits = $[XX]
5-Year Total Investment = Initial $[XX] + Operating $[XX] = $[XX]
Net Profit = $[XX] - $[XX] = $[XX]

ROI = ($[XX] / $[XX]) × 100 = [XX]%
```

### NPV Calculation

Discount Rate: [XX]%

```
NPV = -$[XX] (Initial Investment)
    + $[XX]/(1.[XX])^1
    + $[XX]/(1.[XX])^2
    + $[XX]/(1.[XX])^3
    + $[XX]/(1.[XX])^4
    + $[XX]/(1.[XX])^5
    = $[XX]
```

### IRR

```
IRR = [XX]% (Discount rate where NPV = 0)
```

### Payback Period

```
Payback Period = [X] years + ($[XX] / $[XX]) = [X.XX] years
```

## 5. Sensitivity Analysis

### Scenario-Based Financial Metrics

| Scenario | Assumptions | NPV | ROI | IRR | Payback |
|----------|-------------|-----|-----|-----|---------|
| Optimistic | Benefits +20%, Costs -10% | $[XX] | [XX]% | [XX]% | [X.X] yrs |
| Base Case | As planned | $[XX] | [XX]% | [XX]% | [X.X] yrs |
| Pessimistic | Benefits -20%, Costs +10% | $[XX] | [XX]% | [XX]% | [X.X] yrs |
| Worst Case | Benefits -30%, Costs +20% | $[XX] | [XX]% | [XX]% | [X.X] yrs |

### Break-Even Analysis

- Benefits would need to decrease by [XX]% for NPV = 0
- Costs would need to increase by [XX]% for NPV = 0

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | [High/Medium/Low] | [High/Medium/Low] | [Mitigation strategy] |
| [Risk 2] | [High/Medium/Low] | [High/Medium/Low] | [Mitigation strategy] |
| [Risk 3] | [High/Medium/Low] | [High/Medium/Low] | [Mitigation strategy] |
