# Interview Methodology Guide

## Overview

This guide provides structured interview methodology for consistent, fair, and effective candidate evaluation. It covers the STAR method, structured interviewing best practices, and bias mitigation techniques.

## Structured Interview Framework

### Why Structured Interviews?

| Factor | Unstructured | Structured |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Predictive Validity | Low (0.14) | High (0.51) |
| Legal Defensibility | Low | High |
| Consistency | Variable | Standardized |
| Candidate Experience | Inconsistent | Fair, Professional |

### Components of Structured Interviews

1. **Standardized Questions** - Same questions for all candidates
2. **Job-Related Content** - Questions tied to competencies
3. **Behavioral Focus** - Past behavior predicts future performance
4. **Systematic Evaluation** - Objective rating scales
5. **Multiple Interviewers** - Diverse perspectives

## The STAR Method

### Framework Overview

**STAR** is a behavioral interviewing technique that helps candidates provide structured, complete answers:

| Component | Definition | Listen For |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| **S**ituation | Context and background | When, where, who was involved |
| **T**ask | Specific responsibility | Their role and objectives |
| **A**ction | Steps taken | What they specifically did |
| **R**esult | Outcome achieved | Measurable impact, learnings |

### Probing Techniques

When candidates give incomplete answers, use probes:

| Component Missing | Probe Question |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Situation | "Can you describe the context in more detail?" |
| Task | "What was your specific responsibility in this situation?" |
| Action | "What specific steps did you take?" |
| Result | "What was the outcome? How did you measure success?" |

### STAR Examples by Competency

#### Problem Solving

**Question**: "Tell me about a time you solved a complex problem that others couldn't."

**Ideal STAR Response:**
- **S**: "Our payment processing system was failing intermittently..."
- **T**: "As the senior engineer, I was tasked with finding the root cause..."
- **A**: "I analyzed the logs, identified a race condition, and implemented a fix..."
- **R**: "Reduced failures by 99%, saving $50K/month in failed transactions."

#### Leadership

**Question**: "Describe a situation where you had to lead a team through a difficult change."

**Ideal STAR Response:**
- **S**: "Our team needed to migrate from legacy to new platform in 3 months..."
- **T**: "As team lead, I was responsible for planning and executing the migration..."
- **A**: "I created a phased plan, held weekly syncs, addressed resistance..."
- **R**: "Completed on time with 100% team retention and zero downtime."

#### Conflict Resolution

**Question**: "Tell me about a time you resolved a conflict with a colleague."

**Ideal STAR Response:**
- **S**: "A colleague and I disagreed on the project architecture approach..."
- **T**: "I needed to find common ground while meeting project requirements..."
- **A**: "I scheduled a 1:1, listened to their concerns, proposed a hybrid solution..."
- **R**: "We implemented the hybrid approach, and the colleague became a strong advocate."

## Question Design

### Behavioral Question Stems

| Purpose | Question Stem |
|---------|---------------|
| General | "Tell me about a time when..." |
| Success | "Describe a situation where you successfully..." |
| Challenge | "Give an example of a difficult situation where..." |
| Failure | "Tell me about a time when something didn't go as planned..." |
| Learning | "Describe a situation that taught you an important lesson..." |

### Questions by Competency

#### Technical Skills

- "Walk me through a complex technical project you led."
- "Describe how you approached learning a new technology."
- "Tell me about a time you had to debug a particularly difficult issue."

#### Communication

- "Give an example of explaining a complex concept to a non-technical audience."
- "Describe a situation where you had to deliver difficult feedback."
- "Tell me about a time you had to persuade stakeholders to change direction."

#### Collaboration

- "Tell me about a time you worked effectively on a cross-functional team."
- "Describe how you handled a situation where team members disagreed."
- "Give an example of helping a colleague succeed."

#### Adaptability

- "Tell me about a time you had to change your approach mid-project."
- "Describe how you handled a sudden change in priorities."
- "Give an example of working effectively with ambiguity."

### Questions to Avoid

| Avoid | Reason | Better Alternative |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| "What are your weaknesses?" | Invites rehearsed answers | "Tell me about a skill you're actively developing." |
| "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?" | Not job-related | "What type of work energizes you?" |
| "Why should we hire you?" | Hypothetical | "What makes you effective in [specific competency]?" |
| "How would you handle..." | Hypothetical | "Tell me about a time when..." |

## Evaluation and Scoring

### Rating Scale

Use a consistent 5-point scale:

| Score | Label | Definition |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Exceptional | Far exceeds expectations; provides compelling examples |
| 4 | Strong | Exceeds expectations; provides solid examples |
| 3 | Adequate | Meets expectations; provides acceptable examples |
| 2 | Limited | Below expectations; examples are weak or partial |
| 1 | Unsatisfactory | Does not meet expectations; no relevant examples |

### Scoring Guidelines

**Rate based on:**
- Relevance of the example to the competency
- Depth and specificity of the response
- Impact and results achieved
- Candidate's specific contribution (vs. team)

**Do NOT rate based on:**
- Personal likability
- Communication style preferences
- Similarity to existing team members
- First impression bias

### Evaluation Matrix

| Competency | Weight | Score | Weighted Score |
|------------|--------|-------|----------------|
| Technical Skills | 30% | 4 | 1.2 |
| Problem Solving | 25% | 3 | 0.75 |
| Communication | 20% | 4 | 0.8 |
| Leadership | 15% | 3 | 0.45 |
| Culture Fit | 10% | 4 | 0.4 |
| **Total** | 100% | - | **3.6** |

## Bias Mitigation

### Common Interview Biases

| Bias | Description | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Halo Effect** | Positive trait influences overall assessment | Rate each competency separately |
| **Horns Effect** | Negative trait influences overall assessment | Focus on specific examples |
| **Similarity Bias** | Prefer candidates similar to self | Use diverse interview panels |
| **First Impression** | Initial impression dominates | Reserve judgment until complete |
| **Contrast Effect** | Compare to previous candidate | Rate against job requirements |
| **Confirmation Bias** | Seek evidence supporting initial view | Consider disconfirming evidence |

### Bias Prevention Strategies

1. **Before Interview**
   - Review job requirements, not resume
   - Prepare questions in advance
   - Set aside assumptions

2. **During Interview**
   - Take detailed notes
   - Ask follow-up questions for clarity
   - Rate after candidate leaves

3. **After Interview**
   - Complete evaluation before discussion
   - Support ratings with specific evidence
   - Challenge group consensus

## Interview Debrief Process

### Debrief Agenda (30 minutes)

| Phase | Time | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| Silent Review | 5 min | Finalize individual ratings |
| Round Robin | 15 min | Each interviewer shares assessment |
| Discussion | 7 min | Address disagreements with evidence |
| Decision | 3 min | Final recommendation |

### Debrief Guidelines

**Do:**
- Cite specific examples from interview
- Acknowledge uncertainty where it exists
- Consider all perspectives
- Focus on job requirements

**Don't:**
- Allow groupthink
- Dismiss concerns without evidence
- Make decisions based on gut feeling
- Rush to consensus

## Special Interview Situations

### Phone/Video Screening

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Technical difficulties | Have backup plan, be patient |
| Reading body language | Focus on verbal cues, ask clarifying questions |
| Building rapport | Extra warm greeting, small talk |
| Distractions | Ask if they're in a quiet place |

### Panel Interviews

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Intimidating format | Introduce all panel members, explain format |
| Question overlap | Assign questions in advance |
| Inconsistent follow-up | Designate primary interviewer per competency |
| Time management | Use timekeeper role |

### Executive Interviews

| Difference | Approach |
|------------|----------|
| Strategic focus | Ask about vision, industry trends |
| Complex situations | Probe for multi-stakeholder dynamics |
| Leadership impact | Focus on organizational outcomes |
| Cultural fit | Assess alignment with company values |

## Interview Documentation

### Note-Taking Best Practices

1. **Record objectively** - What was said, not interpretation
2. **Be specific** - Exact phrases when possible
3. **Note STAR components** - Mark S, T, A, R as candidate speaks
4. **Include non-verbals cautiously** - Only if clearly relevant
5. **Complete during or immediately after** - Memory fades quickly

### Sample Notes Template

```
Competency: Problem Solving
Question: Tell me about a complex problem you solved.

S: Production outage affecting 10K users, 3am Sunday
T: On-call engineer, responsible for resolution
A: Checked logs, identified DB connection issue,
   escalated to DBA, implemented temp fix
R: Restored service in 45 min, permanent fix in 2 days

Rating: 4
Notes: Strong example, clear ownership, good escalation judgment.
Could have mentioned preventive measures.
```

## Legal Considerations

### Questions to Avoid

| Topic | Why Avoid | What to Ask Instead |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| Age | Discrimination | "How many years of experience do you have in X?" |
| Family status | Discrimination | Focus on job requirements |
| Health/Disability | Discrimination | "Can you perform essential functions with/without accommodation?" |
| Religion | Discrimination | "Are you available to work [schedule]?" |
| National origin | Discrimination | "Are you authorized to work in [country]?" |

### Documentation Requirements

1. Keep interview notes for minimum 1 year
2. Document reasons for hiring decisions
3. Ensure consistent process for all candidates
4. Train interviewers on legal requirements
