# Competency Model Design Guide

## Overview

This guide provides methodology for designing and implementing competency models for talent acquisition and performance management. Competency models define the knowledge, skills, abilities, and behaviors required for successful job performance.

## What is a Competency?

A **competency** is a measurable pattern of knowledge, skills, abilities, behaviors, and other characteristics that an individual needs to perform work roles or occupational functions successfully.

### Competency Components

| Component | Definition | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Knowledge** | Information needed to perform the job | Understanding of programming languages |
| **Skills** | Learned abilities to perform tasks | Ability to write clean code |
| **Abilities** | Innate talents or aptitudes | Logical reasoning, spatial thinking |
| **Behaviors** | Observable actions and conduct | Actively seeks feedback, shares knowledge |
| **Other** | Traits, values, motivations | Achievement orientation, integrity |

## Types of Competencies

### 1. Core Competencies

Organization-wide competencies that all employees should demonstrate:

| Competency | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Integrity | Acts ethically and honestly in all situations |
| Customer Focus | Prioritizes customer needs and satisfaction |
| Collaboration | Works effectively with others across teams |
| Continuous Learning | Seeks opportunities for growth and development |
| Accountability | Takes ownership of actions and outcomes |

### 2. Functional Competencies

Job-family or department-specific competencies:

| Function | Example Competencies |
|----------|---------------------|
| Engineering | Technical Design, Code Quality, System Thinking |
| Sales | Negotiation, Relationship Building, Market Knowledge |
| Finance | Financial Analysis, Risk Management, Regulatory Compliance |
| HR | Talent Development, Employee Relations, Organizational Design |

### 3. Role-Specific Competencies

Unique competencies required for specific positions:

| Role | Specific Competencies |
|------|----------------------|
| Senior Engineer | Architecture Design, Technical Leadership, Mentoring |
| Sales Manager | Team Development, Forecast Accuracy, Strategy Execution |
| Product Manager | Roadmap Planning, Stakeholder Management, Data-Driven Decision Making |

## Behavioral Indicators

Behavioral indicators are observable, measurable descriptions of how a competency is demonstrated at different proficiency levels.

### Designing Behavioral Indicators

**Good Behavioral Indicator Characteristics:**

1. **Observable** - Can be seen or heard by others
2. **Measurable** - Can be assessed objectively
3. **Job-Related** - Directly connected to job success
4. **Clear** - Unambiguous, specific language
5. **Positive** - Describes what to do, not what to avoid

**Example: Communication Competency**

| Level | Behavioral Indicators |
|-------|----------------------|
| Basic | Expresses ideas clearly in writing and verbally; listens actively to others |
| Intermediate | Adapts communication style to audience; facilitates discussions effectively |
| Advanced | Influences stakeholders through compelling narratives; handles difficult conversations |
| Expert | Represents organization in public forums; develops communication strategies |

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Avoid | Better Alternative |
|-------|-------------------|
| "Has good communication skills" | "Explains complex concepts in simple terms" |
| "Is a team player" | "Actively offers assistance to team members" |
| "Works hard" | "Completes assigned tasks ahead of deadlines" |
| "Is creative" | "Proposes innovative solutions to problems" |

## Proficiency Levels

### 5-Level Scale (Recommended)

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Awareness** | Basic understanding; requires guidance |
| 2 | **Foundation** | Can perform with supervision; developing skills |
| 3 | **Competent** | Performs independently; meets expectations |
| 4 | **Advanced** | High proficiency; coaches others |
| 5 | **Expert** | Recognized authority; shapes best practices |

### Level Mapping to Roles

| Level | Typical Roles |
|-------|--------------|
| 1-2 | Entry-level, Junior positions |
| 2-3 | Mid-level, Individual Contributors |
| 3-4 | Senior, Lead positions |
| 4-5 | Managers, Directors, Executives |

## Job-Specific Competency Examples

## Competency Assessment Methods

### Assessment Matrix

| Method | Best For | Effort | Objectivity |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Behavioral Interviews | Hiring, Promotion | Medium | High |
| 360-Degree Feedback | Development, Calibration | High | Medium |
| Self-Assessment | Development Planning | Low | Low |
| Observation | On-the-job performance | High | Medium |
| Work Samples | Technical skills | Medium | High |
| Simulations | Complex competencies | High | High |

### Interview Question Design

For each competency, create STAR-based questions:

```
Competency: Problem Solving

Question Set:
1. "Tell me about a time you faced a complex problem with no clear solution."
   - Follow-up: "What was your approach to analyzing the situation?"

2. "Describe a situation where you had to make a decision with incomplete information."
   - Follow-up: "How did you manage the risks?"

3. "Give an example of when you identified a problem before it became critical."
   - Follow-up: "What early warning signs did you notice?"
```

## Building a Competency Model

### Step 1: Define Purpose

| Purpose | Output Focus |
|---------|--------------|
| Hiring | Selection criteria, interview guides |
| Development | Learning paths, career ladders |
| Performance | Evaluation criteria, feedback guides |
| Succession | Leadership pipeline, promotion criteria |

### Step 2: Identify Competencies

1. Review job descriptions and requirements
2. Interview high performers and managers
3. Benchmark against industry standards
4. Validate with stakeholders

### Step 3: Define Levels and Indicators

1. Determine number of proficiency levels
2. Write behavioral indicators for each level
3. Map levels to role expectations
4. Validate with subject matter experts

### Step 4: Validate and Refine

1. Pilot with sample group
2. Collect feedback from assessors
3. Refine based on real-world application
4. Document final model

## Common Competencies Reference

### Universal Competencies

| Thinking | Analytical Thinking, Strategic Thinking, Innovation |
| Delivering | Results Orientation, Quality Focus, Decision Making |
| Relating | Communication, Collaboration, Influence |

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it Simple** - 5-7 competencies per role is optimal
2. **Make it Observable** - All indicators should be observable behaviors
3. **Align to Strategy** - Competencies should support business goals
4. **Review Regularly** - Update competencies as roles evolve
5. **Train Assessors** - Ensure consistent application across the organization
