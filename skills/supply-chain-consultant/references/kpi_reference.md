# Supply Chain KPI Reference

## Operational KPIs

### Delivery Performance
- **On-Time Delivery (OTD)**: % of orders delivered on or before promised date (Target: >=95%)
- **Order Fulfillment Lead Time**: Average days from order receipt to delivery (Target: <=3 days)
- **Perfect Order Rate**: % of orders delivered complete, on-time, damage-free, with correct documentation (Target: >=90%)

### Inventory Management
- **Inventory Turnover**: COGS / Average Inventory (Target: Industry benchmark)
- **Days of Inventory (DOI)**: Average inventory / (COGS/365) (Target: 45-60 days)
- **Stockout Frequency**: # of stockout incidents per month (Target: <5 per month)
- **Excess Inventory**: $ value of inventory >90 days old (Target: <5% of total inventory)
- **Obsolete Inventory**: $ value of inventory >180 days old (Target: <2% of total inventory)

### Demand Planning
- **Forecast Accuracy (MAPE)**: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (Target: <20%)
- **Bias**: Average forecast error (Target: +/-5%)

### Procurement
- **Supplier OTD**: % of supplier deliveries on-time (Target: >=95%)
- **Supplier Quality (PPM)**: Parts per million defects (Target: <500 PPM)
- **Cost Savings**: Annual procurement cost reduction (Target: 3-5%)

### Logistics
- **Transportation Cost per Unit**: Total transportation cost / units shipped (Target: Industry benchmark)
- **Warehouse Utilization**: % of warehouse capacity used (Target: 80-90%)

## Financial KPIs

- **Cash-to-Cash Cycle Time**: Days Inventory Outstanding + Days Sales Outstanding - Days Payable Outstanding (Target: Minimize)
- **Supply Chain Cost as % of Revenue**: Total SC cost / Revenue (Target: 8-12% depending on industry)
- **Total Cost to Serve**: All costs to deliver product to customer (Target: Monitor trend)

## Best Practices

### 1. Cross-Functional Collaboration
- **S&OP**: Monthly alignment between Sales, Operations, Finance
- **New Product Introduction**: Early Supply Chain involvement in product design
- **Customer Service**: Direct communication channel for escalations

### 2. Data-Driven Decision Making
- Demand forecasting with statistical methods
- Inventory optimization with safety stock calculations
- Network optimization with modeling tools

### 3. Continuous Improvement (Lean)
- Identify and eliminate waste (8 wastes: Defects, Overproduction, Waiting, Non-utilized talent, Transportation, Inventory, Motion, Extra-processing)
- Kaizen events for process improvement
- Value stream mapping to visualize and improve flow

### 4. Supply Chain Visibility
- Real-time inventory visibility across network
- Shipment tracking and alerts
- Supplier performance dashboards

### 5. Risk Management
- Supplier risk assessments
- Dual sourcing for critical materials
- Business continuity planning for disruptions

## Common Pitfalls

### Forecast Chasing
Reacting to every forecast change without understanding root cause.
**Solution**: Establish forecast change governance; only adjust for significant, validated changes.

### Excess Safety Stock
Over-buffering inventory "just in case."
**Solution**: Calculate safety stock scientifically based on demand variability and lead time.

### Ignoring Total Cost
Focusing only on purchase price, ignoring logistics, quality, and inventory costs.
**Solution**: Use Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) analysis in sourcing decisions.

### Siloed Decision Making
Each function (Sales, Ops, Finance) optimizing independently.
**Solution**: Implement robust S&OP process to align cross-functionally.

### No Contingency Planning
Assuming supply chain will run smoothly without disruptions.
**Solution**: Develop business continuity plans and stress-test scenarios (supplier bankruptcy, natural disaster, demand surge).
