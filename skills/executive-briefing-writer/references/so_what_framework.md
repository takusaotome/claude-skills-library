# So What? / Why Now? / What Next? Framework

## Overview

The "So What? / Why Now? / What Next?" framework is a structured approach to ensuring every executive communication answers the three most critical questions that decision-makers ask. This framework forces clarity and drives action.

## The Three Questions

### 1. So What? (Relevance)

**Question Being Answered**: "Why should I care about this?"

**Purpose**: Establish the business significance and impact

**What to Include**:
- Quantified business impact (revenue, cost, risk, market share)
- Connection to strategic objectives
- Implications for the organization
- Stakes involved in the decision

**Key Principle**: Every fact presented must answer "So what?" If you can't articulate the business impact, the fact doesn't belong in executive communication.

### 2. Why Now? (Urgency)

**Question Being Answered**: "Why does this need my attention now, not later?"

**Purpose**: Establish time-sensitivity and prioritization

**What to Include**:
- Specific deadlines or milestones
- Windows of opportunity
- Accelerating risks or trends
- Dependencies requiring early decision
- Cost of delay

**Key Principle**: If something isn't urgent, executives will deprioritize it. Make the timing case explicit.

### 3. What Next? (Action)

**Question Being Answered**: "What exactly do you want me to do?"

**Purpose**: Specify the required decision or action

**What to Include**:
- Specific, concrete request
- Clear options if decision is needed
- Timeline for action
- Resources required
- Who is accountable

**Key Principle**: Vague requests get vague responses (or none). Be explicit about the action needed.

## Applying the Framework

### Step 1: Gather Your Information

Before applying the framework, collect:
- Key data points and findings
- Background context
- Stakeholder perspectives
- Options and alternatives
- Risks and constraints

### Step 2: Extract the So What?

**Process**:
1. Take each finding or fact
2. Ask "So what?" repeatedly until you reach business impact
3. Quantify the impact where possible

**Example Drill-Down**:
```
Fact: Customer support call volume increased 35%
  → So what?
Wait times increased to 15 minutes average
  → So what?
Customer satisfaction scores dropped 20 points
  → So what?
We risk losing $1.2M in renewals this quarter if we don't address this
  → THIS is your "So What"
```

**Bad Example**: "Customer support call volume increased 35%."
**Good Example**: "We risk losing $1.2M in renewals this quarter due to customer dissatisfaction from long support wait times."

### Step 3: Establish the Why Now?

**Urgency Triggers Checklist**:

| Trigger Type | Description | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Hard Deadline** | External date that cannot move | Regulatory compliance by Dec 31 |
| **Budget Cycle** | Financial planning windows | FY25 budget lock in 2 weeks |
| **Competitive Threat** | Market timing | Competitor launching in Q1 |
| **Accelerating Risk** | Problem getting worse | Churn rate up 5% each month |
| **Opportunity Window** | Time-limited chance | Partner available only this quarter |
| **Dependency** | Blocking other work | Platform decision blocks 3 projects |
| **Cost of Delay** | Quantified waiting penalty | $50K additional cost per month of delay |

**Example**:
```
Weak: "We should address this soon."
Strong: "Budget lock is November 15. If we don't approve this by then, we delay implementation by 9 months and lose the Q1 market opportunity."
```

### Step 4: Define the What Next?

**Action Request Format**:
```
[VERB] + [SPECIFIC THING] + [BY WHEN] + [RESOURCES IF APPLICABLE]
```

**Verb Options by Type**:

| Request Type | Verbs | Example |
|--------------|-------|---------|
| **Approval** | Approve, Authorize, Sign off on | "Approve the $500K budget allocation" |
| **Decision** | Decide, Choose, Select | "Decide between Option A and Option B" |
| **Resource** | Assign, Allocate, Provide | "Assign 2 engineers for 4 weeks" |
| **Direction** | Advise, Guide, Clarify | "Clarify our position on vendor negotiations" |
| **Information** | Review, Note, Be aware | "No action needed. FYI on competitive development." |

**Bad Example**: "We should improve customer service."
**Good Example**: "Approve hiring 4 additional support agents at $320K annual cost. Decision needed by Nov 10 to have agents trained before holiday peak."

## Framework Application Examples

### Example 1: Status Report

**Situation**: Quarterly project update

**Without Framework**:
> "Project Alpha is 75% complete. We finished the database migration and started user testing. There were some bugs found but we're addressing them. The team is working hard."

**With Framework**:
> **So What?** "Project Alpha is on track to deliver $2.4M annual savings. User testing shows 30% efficiency gains, exceeding the 20% target."
>
> **Why Now?** "Go-live decision needed by Nov 15 to capture Q1 savings. Delay would cost $200K per month."
>
> **What Next?** "Approve pilot rollout to Finance department. Review 2-week pilot results on Dec 1."

### Example 2: Resource Request

**Situation**: Requesting additional headcount

**Without Framework**:
> "We need more engineers. The team is stretched thin and we're having trouble keeping up with the roadmap. Other teams have more resources. Please consider adding headcount."

**With Framework**:
> **So What?** "Without additional engineers, we'll miss Q2 product launch, putting $3M projected revenue at risk."
>
> **Why Now?** "Engineers take 3 months to fully onboard. To ship Q2, we need to start hiring in January. Recruiting needs 2 weeks to post jobs."
>
> **What Next?** "Approve 2 senior engineer positions at $400K total annual cost. I need approval by December 20 to meet the hiring timeline."

### Example 3: Risk Escalation

**Situation**: Alerting leadership to a problem

**Without Framework**:
> "There's an issue with our payment processor. We're seeing some failed transactions and customers are complaining. The vendor says they're working on it."

**With Framework**:
> **So What?** "Payment processor outage is causing $50K/hour in failed transactions. 200 customers impacted so far with 15 formal complaints."
>
> **Why Now?** "Black Friday is in 72 hours. If not resolved, we project $2M in lost sales over the holiday weekend."
>
> **What Next?** "Authorize emergency switch to backup processor ($15K setup fee). Decision needed in 4 hours to complete switch before Black Friday traffic."

### Example 4: Strategic Recommendation

**Situation**: Proposing a new initiative

**Without Framework**:
> "We should consider expanding to the European market. There's strong demand and competitors are already there. Our product would be well-received."

**With Framework**:
> **So What?** "European expansion represents $15M revenue opportunity by Year 3, with 40% margins after initial investment."
>
> **Why Now?** "EU data privacy regulations change in 18 months, making entry significantly more expensive after that deadline. Competitor X is entering Q2 2025."
>
> **What Next?** "Approve Phase 1: $1.2M investment for UK market entry. Authorize hiring of EU Country Manager. Decision needed by January board meeting."

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Weak So What?

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "Sales were down this quarter" | "Sales down 15% risks missing annual target by $2M" |
| "Customer complaints increased" | "Complaint surge indicates potential 25% churn risk, $500K ARR exposure" |
| "Project is behind schedule" | "3-week delay puts Q2 launch at risk, impacting $3M projected revenue" |

**Fix**: Keep asking "So what?" until you reach financial or strategic impact.

### Pitfall 2: Vague Why Now?

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "We should do this soon" | "Decision needed by Nov 15 to meet Q1 launch window" |
| "This is becoming urgent" | "Every month of delay costs $50K and loses 2% market share" |
| "Time-sensitive opportunity" | "Partner offer expires December 31; no extension possible" |

**Fix**: Always include a specific date or quantified cost of delay.

### Pitfall 3: Ambiguous What Next?

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "Please advise" | "Approve Option B budget of $500K by Friday" |
| "Let me know your thoughts" | "Decide: continue with Vendor A or switch to Vendor B" |
| "We need support" | "Assign Smith and Jones to project for 6 weeks" |

**Fix**: Use specific verbs and include timeline and resources.

## Industry-Specific Examples

>
> **What Next?** "Approve reprioritization: move Feature X to top of roadmap, delaying Feature Y by one sprint."

### Manufacturing

> **So What?** "Component supplier quality issues causing 5% defect rate, $300K in warranty costs this quarter."
