# Executive Communication Guide

## Overview

This guide provides principles and best practices for communicating effectively with executives. Executives operate under severe time constraints and information overload. Your communication must be precise, relevant, and action-oriented.

## Core Principles

### 1. Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)

**Definition**: State your main message, conclusion, or recommendation in the first sentence.

**Why It Matters**: Executives may only read the first paragraph. If your conclusion is buried, it may never be seen.

**Examples**:

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| "After analyzing Q3 data across all regions, reviewing customer feedback, and comparing to industry benchmarks, we found that..." | "We should exit the EMEA market by Q2. Analysis shows $2M annual loss with no path to profitability." |
| "I wanted to schedule a meeting to discuss the project status and some concerns that have come up recently." | "Project Alpha will miss its deadline by 3 weeks. I need your decision on scope reduction by Friday." |

### 2. The 30-Second Rule

**Definition**: Your core message must be understood within 30 seconds of reading.

**Implementation**:
- Lead with the conclusion
- Use bullet points for key facts
- Limit executive summary to 3-5 sentences
- Put supporting details in appendices

**Test**: Can someone understand your main point by reading only the first paragraph?

### 3. The Elevator Pitch Structure

For verbal or very short written communications:

```
SITUATION: [Current state in one sentence]
COMPLICATION: [What changed or what's wrong]
RESOLUTION: [Your recommendation]
```

**Example**:
> "Our customer acquisition cost increased 40% this quarter (situation). If this continues, we'll miss annual targets by $5M (complication). I recommend pausing paid advertising and reallocating to referral programs (resolution)."

### 4. Respect for Time

**Executive Attention Budgets**:
- CEO: 2-5 minutes per topic
- C-Suite: 5-10 minutes per topic
- VP/Director: 10-20 minutes per topic

**Implications**:
- Documents should have one-page summaries
- Meetings should have pre-reads distributed 24+ hours ahead
- Verbal updates should be under 3 minutes

## Writing Guidelines

### Structure

**Ideal Document Structure**:
```
1. Executive Summary (1 paragraph)
   - What's the issue/opportunity?
   - What do you recommend?
   - What do you need from the reader?

2. Key Findings (3-5 bullet points)
   - Most important facts supporting your recommendation

3. Recommendation Details (if needed)
   - Options considered
   - Rationale for recommendation
   - Risks and mitigations

4. Appendix (optional)
   - Detailed data
   - Methodology
   - Supporting analysis
```

### Tone and Language

**Do**:
- Use active voice ("We recommend" not "It is recommended")
- Be direct ("Reject this proposal" not "This proposal may not be ideal")
- Quantify everything possible ("$2M savings" not "significant savings")
- Use consistent terminology

**Don't**:
- Use hedging language ("perhaps", "might", "somewhat")
- Include unnecessary caveats
- Use jargon without explanation
- Bury bad news

### Numbers and Data

**Formatting Rules**:
- Round appropriately: $2.3M not $2,347,892.43
- Use consistent units: all in thousands or all in millions
- Include context: "+15% vs. target" not just "15%"
- Show trends: "up from $1.8M last quarter"

**Avoid Data Dumps**:
- Maximum 5 numbers in executive summary
- Use tables for comparisons
- Highlight the most important number

## Communication Channels

### Email

**Subject Line**: Include action needed and deadline
- Bad: "Q3 Update"
- Good: "DECISION NEEDED by Friday: Q3 Budget Reallocation"

**Structure**:
```
Subject: [ACTION/FYI] Topic - Deadline if applicable

First paragraph: BLUF (what do you need, what's the conclusion)

Second paragraph: Essential context (2-3 sentences max)

Third paragraph: Next steps or specific ask

```

### Presentations

**Structure**:
- Slide 1: Title and one-line summary
- Slide 2: Executive summary with recommendation
- Slides 3-5: Supporting evidence
- Last slide: Decision/action requested

**Design Rules**:
- One message per slide
- Maximum 5 bullet points
- Titles should be assertions, not topics ("Revenue Up 23%" not "Revenue Overview")

### Meetings

**Preparation**:
- Send pre-read 24-48 hours before
- State purpose and desired outcome in invite
- Prepare for questions executives will ask

**Structure**:
- First 2 minutes: State purpose and desired outcome
- Middle: Present key information
- Last 5 minutes: Discussion and decisions
- End: Confirm next steps and owners

## Anticipating Executive Questions

**Common Questions to Prepare For**:

1. **So what?** - Why does this matter?
2. **What are the options?** - What choices do we have?
3. **What's the risk?** - What could go wrong?
4. **What's the cost?** - Financial and resource impact
5. **What's the timeline?** - When does this need to happen?
6. **Who's responsible?** - Who owns this?
7. **What do you need from me?** - What decision or action is required?

## Handling Difficult Topics

### Delivering Bad News

**Do**:
- Lead with the news (don't bury it)
- Own the problem
- Present the mitigation plan
- Be specific about impact

**Don't**:
- Make excuses
- Blame others
- Minimize the issue
- Delay telling them

**Example**:
> "The product launch will be delayed 6 weeks. Root cause: third-party API integration failed testing. Impact: $500K in marketing spend at risk. Mitigation: We've secured a backup vendor and can launch 2 weeks later than planned. I need approval for the additional $80K vendor cost today."

### Requesting Resources

**Structure**:
```
1. What I need: [Specific request]
2. Why: [Business impact/opportunity]
3. Alternatives considered: [Other options and why not chosen]
4. Risk of not doing: [Consequences of inaction]
5. Ask: [Specific decision needed]
```

### Escalating Issues

**When to Escalate**:
- Issue is beyond your authority
- Risk exceeds your risk tolerance
- Decision needs cross-functional alignment
- Time-sensitive with significant impact

**Escalation Format**:
```
Issue: [One sentence description]
Impact: [Quantified consequence]
Deadline: [When decision is needed]
Options: [A, B, C with pros/cons]
Recommendation: [Your suggested course]
Ask: [Specific decision or action needed]
```

## Cultural Considerations

### Different Executive Styles

| Style | Preference | Adjust By |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Data-driven | Numbers and analysis | Lead with metrics, include methodology |
| Vision-focused | Big picture and strategy | Connect to company goals, use narrative |
| Action-oriented | Quick decisions, next steps | Be concise, focus on actions |
| Consensus-builder | Stakeholder alignment | Show who's been consulted, address concerns |

### Regional Differences

| Region | Communication Tendency | Adaptation |
|--------|------------------------|------------|
| US | Direct, get-to-the-point | BLUF approach works well |
| Japan | Context first, indirect | More background before conclusion |
| Germany | Detailed, thorough | Include supporting data |
| UK | Understated, diplomatic | Less aggressive language |

## Quality Checklist

Before sending any executive communication:

**Content**:
- [ ] BLUF is in the first sentence
- [ ] Key message is clear in 30 seconds
- [ ] Numbers are rounded and in context
- [ ] Recommendation is specific and actionable
- [ ] Risks are acknowledged

**Format**:
- [ ] Executive summary is under 5 sentences
- [ ] No jargon or unexplained acronyms
- [ ] Consistent formatting throughout
- [ ] Easy to scan (bullets, tables, headers)
- [ ] Action items are explicit

**Ask**:
- [ ] Clear what decision/action is needed
- [ ] Deadline for response is specified
- [ ] Decision-maker has authority to act
- [ ] Supporting information is available if needed

## Common Mistakes

1. **Burying the lead**: Putting the conclusion at the end instead of the beginning
2. **Information overload**: Including everything instead of curating the essential
3. **Vague asks**: "Let me know what you think" instead of "Approve Option A by Friday"
4. **Missing context**: Assuming the executive remembers all the background
5. **Overuse of caveats**: Undermining your own recommendation with too many qualifications
6. **No options**: Presenting only one path instead of alternatives
7. **Ignoring politics**: Not considering stakeholder dynamics and concerns
