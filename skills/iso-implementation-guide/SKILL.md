## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Gap Analysis

**Purpose**: Assess current state vs. ISO requirements and identify gaps.

#### Step 1: Document Review
- Collect existing policies, procedures, records
- Review organizational structure and processes
- Understand current practices

#### Step 2: Requirement Mapping
Create a checklist of all ISO requirements and assess compliance:

**Example (ISO 9001 Clause 4.1 - Understanding the Organization)**:
```
Requirement: The organization shall determine external and internal issues relevant to its purpose.

Current State:
- No formal process for identifying issues
- Ad-hoc discussion in management meetings
- No documentation

Gap: HIGH
Action Required:
1. Establish process for identifying internal/external issues
2. Document issues in context analysis
3. Review quarterly
```

#### Step 3: Gap Scoring
```
Compliance Level:
5 - Fully compliant (evidence available)
4 - Mostly compliant (minor gaps)
3 - Partially compliant (significant gaps)
2 - Minimally compliant (major gaps)
1 - Not compliant (no evidence)
0 - Not applicable

Overall Maturity = Average of all applicable clauses
```

#### Step 4: Prioritize Gaps
**Priority Matrix**:
```
       High Risk
         │
  High  │  High
Priority│Priority
         │
  ───────┼───────
         │
  Medium│  Low
Priority│Priority
         │
      Low Compliance
```

**Output**: Gap Analysis Report with prioritized action plan

## Best Practices

### 1. Management Commitment is Critical
ISO certification requires visible, active support from top management.

### 2. Keep Documentation Simple
Don't over-document. "Say what you do, do what you say."

### 3. Integrate with Existing Processes
Don't create parallel processes. Build ISO into daily work.

### 4. Train Everyone
Awareness training for all, detailed training for process owners.

### 5. Use Templates and Tools
Leverage templates to accelerate documentation.

### 6. Conduct Mock Audits
Practice before the real certification audit.

### 7. Focus on Continual Improvement
ISO is not just certification—it's about ongoing improvement.

### 8. Maintain After Certification
Annual surveillance audits require ongoing compliance.

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Documentation Overload
Creating excessive documentation that nobody uses.
**Solution**: Minimum necessary documentation.

### ❌ Lack of Management Involvement
Treating ISO as "Quality Department's project."
**Solution**: Engage executives from day one.

### ❌ Certification as the Goal
Viewing certification as the end, not the means.
**Solution**: Focus on benefits, not just the certificate.

### ❌ Insufficient Training
Employees don't understand their role.
**Solution**: Comprehensive training program.

### ❌ Poor Record Keeping
No evidence to show during audits.
**Solution**: Systematic record keeping from day one.
