# ADKAR Framework Reference

## Overview

ADKAR is an individual change model developed by Prosci that represents the five outcomes an individual needs to achieve for change to be successful. Each element builds on the previous one in sequence.

## The Five Elements

### A - Awareness (認識)

**Definition**: Understanding why the change is necessary.

**Key Questions**:
- Do stakeholders understand the business reasons for change?
- Are they aware of the risks of not changing?
- Do they understand the nature and scope of the change?

**Building Awareness**:
- Executive communications explaining the "why"
- Business case presentations
- Data and evidence of need for change
- Customer/market feedback sharing
- Competitive analysis presentations

**Common Barriers**:
- Lack of visibility into business drivers
- Conflicting messages from leadership
- Information overload from multiple initiatives
- Distrust of management motives

### D - Desire (意欲)

**Definition**: Personal motivation to participate and support the change.

**Key Questions**:
- Do individuals want to change?
- Are they motivated by personal benefits?
- Do they see "what's in it for me" (WIIFM)?

**Building Desire**:
- Address personal concerns and fears
- Communicate WIIFM clearly
- Involve individuals in change design
- Use peer influence and champions
- Connect change to personal values/goals

**Common Barriers**:
- Fear of job loss
- Comfort with status quo
- Lack of trust in leadership
- Negative past change experiences
- No perceived personal benefit

### K - Knowledge (知識)

**Definition**: Information on how to change (behaviors, processes, tools).

**Key Questions**:
- Do people know what to do differently?
- Do they understand new processes/systems?
- Have they received adequate training?

**Building Knowledge**:
- Formal training programs
- Job aids and quick reference guides
- Coaching and mentoring
- Hands-on practice opportunities
- Documentation and knowledge bases

**Common Barriers**:
- Insufficient training time
- Poor training quality
- Information overload
- Lack of practice opportunities
- Training too early/late relative to go-live

### A - Ability (能力)

**Definition**: Demonstrated capability to implement change.

**Key Questions**:
- Can people actually perform in the new way?
- Have they practiced enough?
- Do they have the required skills?

**Building Ability**:
- Hands-on practice in safe environment
- Coaching and real-time support
- Sufficient time to develop proficiency
- Remove barriers to performance
- Provide tools and resources

**Common Barriers**:
- Inadequate practice time
- Physical or psychological blocks
- Insufficient support resources
- Time pressure to perform immediately
- Lack of accessible help when needed

### R - Reinforcement (強化)

**Definition**: Internal and external factors that sustain the change.

**Key Questions**:
- Are new behaviors being reinforced?
- Are successes being celebrated?
- Are there consequences for reverting?

**Building Reinforcement**:
- Celebrate successes publicly
- Recognize change champions
- Align rewards and incentives
- Measure and share progress
- Address relapses quickly
- Update policies and procedures

**Common Barriers**:
- Lack of recognition for new behaviors
- Rewards misaligned with change
- Leaders reverting to old ways
- No accountability for adoption
- Declaring victory too early

## ADKAR Assessment Process

### Step 1: Identify Assessment Target
- Individual, team, or stakeholder group
- Specific aspect of change being assessed

### Step 2: Score Each Element (1-10)
```
1-3: Very low / Not present
4-5: Low / Beginning stages
6-7: Moderate / In progress
8-9: High / Near complete
10:  Complete / Fully achieved
```

### Step 3: Identify Barrier Point
The lowest-scoring element is the "barrier point" - focus interventions here.

### Step 4: Develop Targeted Actions
Design specific interventions for the barrier point element.

## Assessment Template

```markdown
## ADKAR Assessment: [Stakeholder/Group]

| Element | Score | Evidence | Gap Actions |
|---------|-------|----------|-------------|
| Awareness | X/10 | [Observations] | [Actions if <8] |
| Desire | X/10 | [Observations] | [Actions if <8] |
| Knowledge | X/10 | [Observations] | [Actions if <8] |
| Ability | X/10 | [Observations] | [Actions if <8] |
| Reinforcement | X/10 | [Observations] | [Actions if <8] |

**Barrier Point**: [Lowest element]
**Priority Actions**: [Specific interventions]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Sequential focus**: Address elements in order (A→D→K→A→R)
2. **Measure repeatedly**: Assess at multiple points during change
3. **Customize interventions**: Tailor actions to specific barrier points
4. **Individual vs. group**: Aggregate individual assessments for group view
5. **Leading indicator**: Use ADKAR scores to predict adoption success
