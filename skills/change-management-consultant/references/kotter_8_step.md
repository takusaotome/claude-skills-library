# Kotter's 8-Step Change Model Reference

## Overview

Dr. John Kotter's 8-Step Process for Leading Change is a sequential framework for driving organizational transformation. Published in "Leading Change" (1996), this model emphasizes creating momentum through a structured approach.

## The Eight Steps

### Phase 1: Creating the Climate for Change

#### Step 1: Create Urgency (危機感を高める)

**Purpose**: Help others see the need for change through a compelling reason.

**Actions**:
- Identify potential threats and opportunities
- Develop scenarios showing what could happen
- Examine competitive dynamics and market position
- Share data and evidence of need
- Request input from customers, stakeholders, analysts

**Success Indicators**:
- 75%+ of leadership is genuinely convinced
- People start discussing the change urgently
- Status quo becomes uncomfortable

**Common Mistakes**:
- Underestimating the difficulty of driving change
- Relying on data alone without emotional appeal
- Not involving enough key stakeholders

#### Step 2: Build Guiding Coalition (変革推進チームを作る)

**Purpose**: Assemble a group with enough power to lead the change.

**Actions**:
- Identify true leaders (not just managers)
- Include people with positional power and expertise
- Ensure credibility and trust with organization
- Work as a team outside normal hierarchy
- Commit to significant change

**Ideal Coalition Composition**:
- Position power (key titles)
- Expertise (relevant knowledge)
- Credibility (reputation)
- Leadership (proven ability to lead)

**Common Mistakes**:
- No line managers in coalition
- Weak leadership at the top
- Coalition members who undermine each other

#### Step 3: Form Strategic Vision (ビジョンと戦略を生み出す)

**Purpose**: Create a vision that directs the change effort.

**Actions**:
- Clarify how the future will differ from the past
- Create clear, compelling vision statement
- Develop strategy to achieve the vision
- Ensure guiding coalition can describe vision in 5 minutes
- Test vision for clarity and buy-in

**Vision Characteristics** (SUCCES):
- Simple: Easy to communicate
- Imaginable: Conveys picture of future
- Desirable: Appeals to stakeholders
- Feasible: Realistic and attainable
- Focused: Clear enough to guide decisions
- Flexible: General enough to allow initiatives

**Common Mistakes**:
- Vision is too complicated
- Vision is vague or uninspiring
- No strategy to achieve vision

### Phase 2: Engaging and Enabling the Organization

#### Step 4: Communicate the Vision (変革のビジョンを周知徹底する)

**Purpose**: Get as many people as possible to understand and accept the vision.

**Actions**:
- Use every communication channel available
- Keep messages simple and jargon-free
- Repeat vision constantly
- Lead by example (walk the talk)
- Address concerns and anxieties openly
- Use two-way communication

**Communication Rules**:
- 7x: Messages must be repeated 7 times to be remembered
- Multiple channels: Email, meetings, town halls, 1:1s
- Stories and metaphors: Make vision memorable
- Actions speak: Leaders must model the change

**Common Mistakes**:
- Under-communicating by factor of 10x
- Actions inconsistent with words
- Key leaders not leading by example

#### Step 5: Enable Action by Removing Barriers (従業員の自発を促す)

**Purpose**: Remove obstacles that block the vision.

**Actions**:
- Remove structural barriers to change
- Align systems and processes with vision
- Provide training for new skills
- Address supervisors who undermine change
- Recognize and reward new behaviors

**Common Barriers**:
- Organizational structure
- Narrow job categories
- Compensation systems
- Performance appraisal systems
- Resistant supervisors

**Common Mistakes**:
- Failing to remove powerful individuals who resist
- Not aligning HR systems with change
- Not providing adequate training

#### Step 6: Generate Short-Term Wins (短期的成果を実現する)

**Purpose**: Create visible, unambiguous successes as soon as possible.

**Actions**:
- Plan for visible improvements (wins)
- Create those wins
- Recognize and reward contributors
- Publicize wins widely
- Use wins to build momentum

**Characteristics of Good Short-Term Wins**:
- Visible: Large numbers can see results
- Unambiguous: Clear cause and effect
- Related to change: Clearly connected to initiative
- Quick: Within 6-18 months

**Common Mistakes**:
- Not creating short-term wins (hoping for long-term only)
- Leaving wins to chance
- Not celebrating and communicating wins

### Phase 3: Implementing and Sustaining the Change

#### Step 7: Sustain Acceleration (成果を生かして更なる変革を進める)

**Purpose**: Use credibility from wins to tackle bigger problems.

**Actions**:
- Use increased credibility to change more
- Hire, promote people who can implement vision
- Reinvigorate process with new projects and themes
- Keep urgency level up
- Don't declare victory too soon

**Key Activities**:
- More change, not less
- More help: Bring in additional change agents
- Leadership from senior management
- Project management from below

**Common Mistakes**:
- Declaring victory too soon
- Allowing urgency to drop
- Not removing systems that anchor past

#### Step 8: Institute Change (新しい方法を企業文化に定着させる)

**Purpose**: Make new behaviors stick by anchoring them in culture.

**Actions**:
- Show connections between new behaviors and success
- Create means to ensure leadership development
- Articulate how new approaches will be sustained
- Update formal processes and systems
- Revise hiring criteria
- Revise promotion criteria

**Culture Change Elements**:
- Norms of behavior
- Shared values
- "How we do things around here"

**Common Mistakes**:
- Not anchoring changes in culture
- Promoting people who don't embody new ways
- Not updating formal systems and processes
