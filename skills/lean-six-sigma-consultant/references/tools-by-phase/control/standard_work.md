# Standard Work Guide

## Overview

Standard Work is the documented best practice for performing a task. It establishes a baseline for continuous improvement and ensures consistent quality regardless of who performs the work.

## Purpose

- **Consistency**: Same results every time
- **Training**: Foundation for teaching new staff
- **Quality**: Reduce variation and defects
- **Improvement**: Baseline for Kaizen
- **Knowledge capture**: Preserve institutional knowledge

---

## Components of Standard Work

### 1. Takt Time
The pace of customer demand.

```
Takt Time = Available Work Time / Customer Demand

Example:
Available time = 480 minutes/day
Customer demand = 240 units/day
Takt Time = 480 / 240 = 2 minutes per unit
```

### 2. Work Sequence
The order of steps to complete a task.

- Most efficient sequence
- Includes all steps
- Clear start and end points
- Logical flow

### 3. Standard Work-in-Process (WIP)
Minimum inventory required to maintain flow.

- Minimum units in process
- Buffer between steps
- Maintains continuous operation

---

## Standard Work Document Types

### 1. Work Instructions
**Purpose**: Step-by-step procedure for operators

**Contents**:
- Sequence of steps
- Key points for each step
- Safety considerations
- Quality checkpoints
- Time for each step
- Required tools and materials

### 2. Standard Work Combination Table
**Purpose**: Show combination of manual work, machine work, and walking

**Format**:
| Step | Description | Manual | Machine | Walk | Total |
|------|-------------|--------|---------|------|-------|
| 1 | Load part | 5s | | | 5s |
| 2 | Start machine | 2s | | | 2s |
| 3 | Machine cycle | | 30s | | 30s |
| 4 | Walk to station B | | | 10s | 10s |

### 3. Standard Work Layout
**Purpose**: Show movement and positioning

**Elements**:
- Workplace layout
- Work path/movement
- Location of materials
- Machine positions
- Safety zones

## Creating Standard Work Documents

### Step 1: Observe Current State
- Watch the process multiple times
- Note variations between operators
- Time each step
- Identify best practices

### Step 2: Identify Best Method
- Compare different approaches
- Select most effective, safe, quality method
- Get input from experienced operators

### Step 3: Document the Standard
- Write clear, step-by-step instructions
- Include visuals (photos, diagrams)
- Note key quality points
- Specify tools and materials
- Document time for each step

### Step 4: Validate
- Have multiple operators try the documented method
- Confirm results are consistent
- Adjust as needed

### Step 5: Train
- Train all operators on standard
- Verify competency
- Post at workstation

### Step 6: Audit and Improve
- Regular audits for compliance
- Collect improvement ideas
- Update standard when improved

## Visual Work Instructions

### Benefits of Visual Instructions
- Overcome language barriers
- Quick reference
- Reduce errors
- Easier to remember

### Types of Visuals

**Photos**: Actual equipment and parts
**Diagrams**: Simplified representations
**Before/After**: Show correct vs. incorrect
**Callouts**: Highlight key points
**Color coding**: Distinguish elements

### Example Visual Instruction

```
Step 3: Install Gasket

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too detailed**: Overwhelming, not followed
2. **Too vague**: Doesn't provide guidance
3. **Not involving operators**: Missing key insights
4. **Not visual**: Walls of text
5. **Not maintained**: Outdated instructions
6. **Not trained**: Document exists but not used
7. **Not audited**: No verification of compliance
8. **No ownership**: Nobody accountable for updates
