# Solution Generation Guide

## Overview

Solution generation involves developing potential solutions to address verified root causes. This phase requires creativity, collaboration, and systematic evaluation to identify the best solutions.

## Principles

1. **Address root causes**: Solutions must target verified causes, not symptoms
2. **Generate multiple options**: Don't settle for the first idea
3. **Encourage creativity**: All ideas welcome initially
4. **Build on data**: Use Analyze phase insights
5. **Consider constraints**: Feasibility matters

## Technique 1: Brainstorming

### What It Is
A group creativity technique for generating many ideas quickly without judgment.

### Ground Rules

1. **Defer judgment**: No criticism during idea generation
2. **Go for quantity**: More ideas = better chance of good ones
3. **Build on others' ideas**: "Yes, and..." not "No, but..."
4. **Encourage wild ideas**: May spark practical solutions
5. **One conversation**: Listen and build

### Facilitation Tips

**Before**:
- Define the problem clearly
- Set time limits (15-30 minutes)
- Prepare materials (sticky notes, whiteboard)
- Invite diverse participants

**During**:
- Warm up with easy questions
- Write all ideas visibly
- Keep energy high
- Prevent dominance by few
- Build on ideas

**After**:
- Thank participants
- Organize and categorize ideas
- Identify themes
- Prioritize for further evaluation

### Variations

**Brainwriting (6-3-5)**:
- 6 participants write 3 ideas in 5 minutes
- Pass paper to next person, build on ideas
- Repeat 5 times
- Result: 90+ ideas in 30 minutes

**Round Robin**:
- Each person shares one idea in turn
- Continue until ideas exhausted
- Ensures equal participation

**Reverse Brainstorming**:
- Ask: "How could we make this problem worse?"
- Generates causes/anti-solutions
- Reverse to find solutions

## Technique 2: Benchmarking

### What It Is
Learning from best practices of others who have solved similar problems.

### Types of Benchmarking

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Internal** | Compare within organization | Best-performing plant |
| **Competitive** | Compare to direct competitors | Industry rival |
| **Functional** | Compare similar functions | Call center (different industry) |
| **Generic** | Compare general processes | Order fulfillment (any industry) |

### Process

**Step 1: Plan**
- What to benchmark
- Who to benchmark against
- What data needed

**Step 2: Research**
- Identify benchmarking partners
- Gather public information
- Conduct site visits or interviews

**Step 3: Analyze**
- Compare performance metrics
- Identify gaps
- Understand enablers

**Step 4: Adapt**
- Identify applicable practices
- Adapt to your context
- Develop implementation plan

### Questions to Ask

- What processes do they use?
- What makes them successful?
- What resources do they invest?
- What challenges did they face?
- How can we adapt their approach?

## Technique 3: Solution Categories

### Error-Proofing (Poka-Yoke)

**Prevention**: Make it impossible to make error
- Physical constraints
- Interlocks
- Required sequences

**Detection**: Catch errors immediately
- Sensors
- Alarms
- Visual indicators

**Example Poka-Yoke**:
| Error Type | Prevention | Detection |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| Wrong part | Keyed connectors | Color coding |
| Missing step | Forced sequence | Checklist |
| Incorrect data | Dropdown menus | Validation rules |

### Process Changes

- Eliminate steps
- Combine steps
- Simplify steps
- Resequence steps
- Automate steps

### Technology Solutions

- Automation
- Software tools
- Sensors and monitoring
- Data systems

### Organizational Changes

- Training programs
- Role/responsibility changes
- Team structure
- Communication processes

### Standard Work

- Documented procedures
- Visual instructions
- Checklists
- Training materials

## Technique 4: TRIZ Principles

### What It Is
TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) is a systematic approach to innovation based on patterns of invention.

### Key TRIZ Principles (Selected)

| # | Principle | Description | Example |
|---|-----------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Segmentation | Divide into independent parts | Modular design |
| 2 | Taking out | Extract interfering part | Separate noise from signal |
| 5 | Merging | Combine identical objects | Multi-tool |
| 6 | Universality | One part, multiple functions | Smartphone |
| 10 | Preliminary action | Perform required action in advance | Pre-staging |
| 13 | The other way around | Invert action, make moving part fixed | Escalator vs stairs |
| 15 | Dynamics | Allow adaptation to conditions | Auto-adjusting |
| 21 | Skipping | Run process at high speed | Rapid prototyping |
| 24 | Intermediary | Use temporary or connecting object | Buffer, mediator |
| 35 | Parameter changes | Change physical state | Cooling, heating |

### Application

1. Define the problem as a contradiction
2. Identify which TRIZ principles might apply
3. Use principles to generate solution concepts

## Solution Screening

### Initial Screening Questions

For each solution idea, ask:
1. Does it address a verified root cause?
2. Is it technically feasible?
3. Is it within project scope?
4. Can it be implemented within timeline?
5. Does it align with organizational constraints?

### Categorization

Group solutions by:

**Ease of Implementation**:
- Quick wins (easy, fast)
- Projects (medium effort)
- Major initiatives (significant effort)

**Impact Level**:
- High impact on primary metric
- Medium impact
- Low impact

### Impact/Effort Matrix

```
            Low Effort         High Effort
         ┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
High     │   QUICK WINS    │   PROJECTS      │
Impact   │   Do First!     │   Plan & Do     │
         ├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
Low      │   FILL-INS      │   LOW PRIORITY  │
Impact   │   Do If Time    │   Consider Later│
         └─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Jumping to solutions**: Skipping proper analysis
2. **Single solution focus**: Not generating alternatives
3. **Not addressing root cause**: Treating symptoms
4. **Ignoring constraints**: Proposing infeasible solutions
5. **Analysis paralysis**: Over-analyzing instead of acting
6. **Pet solutions**: Pushing predetermined answers
7. **Not involving stakeholders**: Missing key input
8. **Scope creep**: Solutions beyond project boundaries
