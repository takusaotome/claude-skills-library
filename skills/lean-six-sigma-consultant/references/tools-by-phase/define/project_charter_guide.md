# Project Charter Guide

## Overview

The Project Charter is the foundational document for any Six Sigma project. It formally authorizes the project, defines scope and objectives, and aligns stakeholders on what will be accomplished.

## Purpose

- Formally authorize the project
- Define the problem and goals clearly
- Establish scope boundaries
- Identify key stakeholders and team
- Secure resource commitment
- Create alignment among stakeholders

## Key Components

### 1. Business Case

**Purpose**: Justify why this project is important to the organization.

**Content**:
- Strategic alignment: How does this relate to business objectives?
- Financial impact: Cost of poor quality, potential savings
- Customer impact: Effect on customer satisfaction
- Risk of inaction: What happens if we don't fix this?

**Good Business Case Example**:
> "The current order fulfillment process has a 15% error rate, resulting in approximately $500K annual cost of rework and customer credits. Customer complaints have increased 40% over the past year, threatening our Net Promoter Score target of 50. This project aligns with our strategic initiative to become the industry leader in customer service."

### 2. Problem Statement

**Purpose**: Clearly describe what is wrong.

**Components (4W's)**:
- **What**: What is the problem?
- **When**: When does it occur?
- **Where**: Where does it occur?
- **Extent**: How big is the problem? (Quantify)

**Do NOT include**:
- Causes (we don't know them yet)
- Blame
- Solutions
- Opinions

**Good Problem Statement Example**:
> "Since January 2024, the Manufacturing Line 3 has experienced a 12% defect rate in the final assembly step, compared to the target of 2%. This affects approximately 1,200 units per month and results in $180K monthly rework costs."

**Bad Problem Statement Example**:
> "Workers are not trained properly and the equipment is old, causing quality problems. We need to buy new machines and train everyone."
(Contains causes, blame, and solutions)

### 3. Goal Statement (SMART)

**Purpose**: Define what success looks like.

**SMART Criteria**:
- **S**pecific: Clear and precise
- **M**easurable: Quantified target
- **A**chievable: Realistic within constraints
- **R**elevant: Aligned to business need
- **T**ime-bound: Has a deadline

**Good Goal Statement Example**:
> "Reduce the defect rate on Manufacturing Line 3 from 12% to 2% by December 31, 2024, saving an estimated $150K monthly in rework costs."

**Goal Setting Guidelines**:
- Improvement target: 50-70% reduction is typical for Green Belt projects
- Entitlement: Research the best possible performance (benchmark)
- Consider: Past performance, industry benchmarks, physical limits

### 4. Project Scope

**Purpose**: Define boundaries of the project.

**In Scope**: What IS included
- Process start and end points
- Products/services covered
- Locations/departments
- Time period

**Out of Scope**: What is NOT included
- Related but excluded areas
- Constraints
- Known exclusions

**Scope Statement Example**:
```
IN SCOPE:
- Final assembly step on Line 3
- Shifts 1 and 2 (Monday-Friday)
- All product SKUs run on Line 3
- Defects identified at in-line inspection

OUT OF SCOPE:
- Upstream processes (Lines 1, 2)
- Weekend shifts
- Defects found at customer site
- Equipment purchase (capital budget separate)
```

### 5. Primary Metric (Y)

**Purpose**: Define the main measure of success.

**Components**:
- **Metric definition**: What exactly are we measuring?
- **Operational definition**: Precisely how is it measured?
- **Baseline**: Current performance
- **Target**: Goal to achieve
- **Entitlement**: Best possible (benchmark)

**Example**:
```
Metric: Defect Rate (%)
Operational Definition: Number of units failing in-line QC inspection
  divided by total units inspected, expressed as percentage
Baseline: 12%
Target: 2%
Entitlement: 0.5% (industry best practice)
```

### 6. Secondary Metrics

**Purpose**: Track unintended consequences and related measures.

**Types**:
- **Consequential metrics**: Ensure we don't harm other areas
- **Related metrics**: Additional benefits we might achieve

**Example**:
| Metric | Baseline | Target | Purpose |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| Rework cost | $180K/mo | $30K/mo | Financial benefit |
| Cycle time | 45 min | No increase | Don't slow production |
| Safety incidents | 0 | 0 | Don't compromise safety |

### 7. Team

**Purpose**: Identify the project team and roles.

**Key Roles**:

| Role | Responsibility | Time Commitment |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Champion** | Executive sponsor, removes barriers, provides resources | 1-2 hrs/week |
| **Process Owner** | Owns the process, accountable for results | 2-4 hrs/week |
| **Team Leader** | Leads project (Green/Black Belt) | 25-50% |
| **Team Members** | Subject matter experts, execute tasks | 10-20% |

### 8. Timeline

**Purpose**: High-level schedule for the project.

**Typical DMAIC Timeline**:
| Phase | Duration | Tollgate Date |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Define | 2 weeks | [Date] |
| Measure | 3 weeks | [Date] |
| Analyze | 3 weeks | [Date] |
| Improve | 4 weeks | [Date] |
| Control | 2 weeks | [Date] |

### 9. Expected Benefits

**Purpose**: Quantify expected project value.

**Categories**:
- **Hard savings**: Direct cost reduction (quantifiable)
- **Cost avoidance**: Prevented future costs
- **Soft savings**: Difficult to quantify (morale, satisfaction)
- **Revenue impact**: Sales or retention improvements

### 10. Risks and Constraints

**Purpose**: Identify potential project risks.

**Example**:
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Key SME leaves | Medium | High | Cross-train team members |
| Equipment freeze | Low | High | Complete Improve phase before Q4 |
| Data unavailable | Medium | Medium | Start data collection early |

## Charter Approval

The charter should be reviewed and approved by:
- Champion (signature)
- Process Owner (signature)
- Team Leader (signature)

Approval indicates:
- Agreement on problem and goals
- Commitment of resources
- Authorization to proceed

## Charter Review Process

### Initial Review
- Does problem statement clearly describe the issue?
- Are goals SMART?
- Is scope appropriate (not too broad/narrow)?
- Is the team adequate?
- Are resources committed?

### Revision Triggers
Update the charter if:
- Scope needs adjustment
- Goals need revision based on data
- Team changes
- Timeline shifts significantly

Document changes and get re-approval.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Vague problem statement**: "Quality is bad" - Not specific or quantified
2. **Solution embedded**: Already stating the fix before analysis
3. **Too broad scope**: "Improve all manufacturing" - Unachievable
4. **Too narrow scope**: Won't achieve meaningful improvement
5. **No baseline data**: Can't measure improvement without baseline
6. **Unrealistic goals**: 99% improvement in 1 month
7. **Missing stakeholders**: Key people not engaged
