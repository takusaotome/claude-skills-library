# 5S Workplace Organization Guide

## Overview

5S is a systematic approach to workplace organization that creates and maintains an orderly, clean, high-performance work environment. It forms the foundation for continuous improvement and supports Lean operations.

## The 5S Steps

| S | Japanese | English | Meaning |
|---|----------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Seiri | Sort | Remove unnecessary items |
| 2 | Seiton | Set in Order | Organize remaining items |
| 3 | Seiso | Shine | Clean and inspect |
| 4 | Seiketsu | Standardize | Create standards |
| 5 | Shitsuke | Sustain | Maintain discipline |

## Step 1: Sort (Seiri)

### Purpose
Separate necessary from unnecessary items and remove what's not needed.

### Process

**1. Define the area**
- Establish boundaries
- Include all items in scope

**2. Red Tag Campaign**
Apply red tags to questionable items:
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│         RED TAG             │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Date: ________________      │
│ Item: ________________      │
│ Category: [ ] Equipment     │
│           [ ] Tools         │
│           [ ] Materials     │
│           [ ] Other         │
│ Reason: ______________      │
│ Decision: [ ] Keep          │
│           [ ] Move          │
│           [ ] Dispose       │
│ By: ________________        │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**3. Establish criteria**
- Used daily → Keep at workstation
- Used weekly → Keep nearby
- Used monthly → Store in area
- Not used in month → Red tag
- Not used in year → Remove

**4. Process tagged items**
- Move to red tag holding area
- Review and decide disposition
- Dispose, relocate, or return

### Questions to Ask
- When was this last used?
- How often is it needed?
- Does it belong here?
- How many do we really need?
- What is the cost of keeping it?

---

## Step 2: Set in Order (Seiton)

### Purpose
Organize remaining items so anyone can find them easily and return them properly.

### Principles

**"A Place for Everything, Everything in its Place"**

**Organize by frequency of use**:
- Most used → easiest reach
- Less used → further away
- Rarely used → store

**Visual organization**:
- Labels
- Color coding
- Shadow boards
- Floor markings

### Process

**1. Map the workflow**
- Document work sequence
- Identify needed items at each step

**2. Design optimal arrangement**
- Position items for ergonomic access
- Minimize motion and reaching
- Group related items

**3. Create visual systems**
- Labels on everything
- Floor tape for zones
- Shadow boards for tools
- Markings for quantities

**4. Document locations**
- Take photos
- Create location maps
- Update inventory

### Visual Management Tools

**Shadow Board**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  ┌───┐  ╭───╮  ┌───┐  ╭───╮    │
│  │   │  │   │  │   │  │   │    │
│  │ ▢ │  │ ○ │  │ ▢ │  │ ○ │    │
│  │   │  │   │  │   │  │   │    │
│  └───┘  ╰───╯  └───┘  ╰───╯    │
│ Wrench  Hammer  Pliers  Screw  │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
Empty shapes show what's missing
```

**Floor Markings**:
| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Yellow | Aisles, walkways |
| White | Work areas, equipment |
| Red | Defect/scrap areas |
| Green | Finished goods |
| Blue | Raw materials |
| Black/White stripes | Safety hazard |

**Min/Max Markings**:
```
     MAX ────────
      │
      │   Current
      │   Level
      │
     MIN ────────  ← Reorder point
```

## Step 3: Shine (Seiso)

### Purpose
Clean the workplace thoroughly and use cleaning as a form of inspection.

### Principles

**Cleaning = Inspection**
- Find abnormalities while cleaning
- Detect problems early
- Maintain equipment condition

### Process

**1. Initial deep clean**
- Thorough cleaning of everything
- Remove all dirt, grime, debris
- Get back to baseline condition

**2. Identify contamination sources**
- Where does dirt come from?
- How can we prevent it?
- Address root causes

**3. Establish cleaning routines**
- Daily cleaning tasks
- Weekly deep cleaning
- Responsibilities assigned

### Cleaning Checklist Example

```
DAILY CLEANING CHECKLIST - Station A

Shift: _______ Date: _______ Operator: _______

□ Wipe down work surfaces
□ Sweep floor area
□ Empty trash/recycle bins
□ Check fluid levels
□ Inspect for damage/wear
□ Return all tools to shadow board
□ Clear unnecessary items

Abnormalities Found:
________________________________
________________________________

Supervisor Review: _______ Date: _______
```

### Inspection Points
- Leaks (oil, air, water)
- Loose fasteners
- Worn parts
- Damaged equipment
- Safety hazards

## Step 4: Standardize (Seiketsu)

### Purpose
Create standards to maintain the first 3S and ensure consistency.

### Process

**1. Create visual standards**
- Photographs of "correct" state
- Posted at each area
- Before/after comparison

**2. Develop procedures**
- Who does what
- When it's done
- How to do it
- How to verify

**3. Assign responsibilities**
- Area ownership
- Cleaning duties
- Audit responsibilities

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Standard Photo Examples

- Correct tool arrangement
- Clean equipment condition
- Proper material organization

## Common Mistakes

1. **Stopping at Sort**: Must do all 5S
2. **No standards**: Regression inevitable
3. **No audits**: Standards not followed
4. **Management not involved**: Seen as low priority
5. **One-time event**: Not sustained practice
6. **No ownership**: Nobody responsible
7. **Cleaning without inspection**: Missing defects
8. **Too much, too fast**: Overwhelming
