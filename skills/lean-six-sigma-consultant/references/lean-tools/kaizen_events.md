# Kaizen Events Guide

## Overview

A Kaizen Event (also called Kaizen Blitz or Rapid Improvement Event) is a focused, short-term project that improves a specific process area. Teams implement changes during the event itself, achieving rapid results.

## What is Kaizen?

**Kaizen** (改善) = Change (改) + Good (善) = Change for the better

**Philosophy**:
- Continuous improvement
- Small, incremental changes
- Everyone participates
- Focus on process, not blame

**Two Forms**:
1. **Daily Kaizen**: Small improvements as part of normal work
2. **Kaizen Events**: Concentrated improvement efforts (this guide)

## Kaizen Event Characteristics

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Duration | 3-5 days (typically) |
| Team Size | 5-10 people |
| Focus | Specific process or area |
| Output | Implemented improvements |
| Change | Made during the event |

---

## When to Use Kaizen Events

### Good Candidates
- Clearly defined, bounded process
- Team can make changes quickly
- Cross-functional input needed
- Breakthrough improvement desired
- Need to build improvement culture

### Not Appropriate For
- Complex, long-term projects
- Major capital investments
- Issues requiring extensive data collection
- Problems spanning multiple value streams

---

## Kaizen Event Structure

### Phase 1: Preparation (2-4 weeks before)

**1. Select the Target**
- Identify process or area
- Define scope boundaries
- Set improvement objectives

**2. Form the Team**
- Team leader (facilitator)
- Process owner
- Operators who do the work
- Support functions (quality, engineering)
- Fresh eyes (someone unfamiliar with process)

**3. Gather Data**
- Current performance metrics
- Process documentation
- Voice of customer
- Known issues

**4. Logistics**
- Schedule team members full-time
- Reserve event space
- Arrange materials/supplies
- Plan implementation support

### Phase 2: Event Execution (3-5 days)

**Day 1: Understand Current State**

Morning:
- Team introduction and charter review
- Safety briefing
- Quick Lean training (if needed)
- Go to Gemba (observe actual process)

Afternoon:
- Document current state
- Collect data/measurements
- Identify waste
- Brainstorm issues

**Day 2: Analyze and Design**

Morning:
- Review observations
- Root cause analysis
- Prioritize opportunities

Afternoon:
- Generate solutions
- Design future state
- Plan implementation
- Assign tasks

**Day 3: Implement**
- Begin implementation
- Make physical changes
- Update procedures
- Create visual controls

**Day 4: Implement (continued)**
- Continue implementation
- Test changes
- Adjust as needed
- Train operators

**Day 5: Verify and Sustain**

Morning:
- Measure results
- Compare to baseline
- Document learnings
- Finalize standards

Afternoon:
- Create sustainment plan
- Assign ownership
- Present results to leadership
- Celebrate success

### Phase 3: Follow-Up (30-90 days after)

- Monitor sustaining actions

## Kaizen Tools

### A3 Thinking
Single-page problem solving format:
- Background
- Current condition
- Goals/Targets
- Root cause analysis
- Countermeasures
- Implementation plan
- Follow-up

### Rapid Experiments (PDCA)
Small tests during event:
- **Plan**: Propose change
- **Do**: Try it
- **Check**: Measure result
- **Act**: Adopt, adapt, or abandon

### Spaghetti Diagram
Map movement/travel:
```

│           Work Area             │
│                                 │
│  [M1]──┐    ┌──[M2]            │

└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Time Observation
Measure cycle times:
- Work content
- Wait time
- Walk time
- Value-added vs. non-value-added

### Standard Work Combination Sheet
Document sequence:
| Step | Description | Manual | Machine | Walk | Cum. |
|------|-------------|--------|---------|------|------|
| 1 | Load part | 5s | | | 5s |
| 2 | Machine cycle | | 30s | | 35s |
| 3 | Walk to Station B | | | 10s | 45s |

## Implementation Tips

### Making Changes During the Event

**Do's**:
- Make changes immediately when possible
- Use temporary solutions to test ideas
- Involve operators in implementation
- Document before and after
- Take photos/video

**Don'ts**:
- Don't wait for perfect solution
- Don't delay implementation
- Don't skip testing
- Don't ignore safety
- Don't make changes without operator input

### Common Changes Made

- Relocate equipment/supplies
- Create visual controls
- Update procedures
- Reorganize workspace (5S)
- Eliminate steps
- Implement error-proofing
- Create standard work
- Install Kanban systems

## Success Factors

### For Successful Events

1. **Management support**: Resources and authority
2. **Right scope**: Not too big, not too small
3. **Dedicated team**: Full-time for duration
4. **Implementation focus**: Changes made during event
5. **Operator involvement**: Those who do the work
6. **Follow-through**: Sustain improvements

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Scope too broad**: Can't finish in event
2. **Part-time team**: Insufficient focus
3. **Analysis paralysis**: Too much planning, not enough doing
4. **No implementation authority**: Can't make changes
5. **Missing stakeholders**: Changes not accepted
6. **No follow-up**: Improvements fade
7. **Wrong problem**: Not addressing real issue

## Daily Kaizen vs. Events

| Aspect | Daily Kaizen | Kaizen Event |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Duration | Ongoing | 3-5 days |
| Scope | Small, individual | Process area |
| Team | Individual/pair | Cross-functional |
| Changes | Incremental | Breakthrough |
| Formal | Informal | Structured |
| Approval | Simple | Pre-approved |

**Best Practice**: Use both - Daily Kaizen sustains and builds on Event improvements.
