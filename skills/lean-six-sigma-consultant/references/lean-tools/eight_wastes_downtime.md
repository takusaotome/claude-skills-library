## Overview

Waste (Muda in Japanese) is any activity that consumes resources but creates no value for the customer. The 8 wastes are remembered using the acronym DOWNTIME.

## The DOWNTIME Acronym

| **W** | Waiting | Idle time when work is not progressing |
| **N** | Non-utilized talent | Not using people's skills and ideas |
| **T** | Transportation | Unnecessary movement of materials |
| **I** | Inventory | Excess raw materials, WIP, or finished goods |

## O - Overproduction

### Definition
Producing more than the customer needs, or producing it before it's needed.

### Why It's the Worst Waste
Overproduction causes all other wastes:
- Creates excess inventory
- Requires more transportation
- Generates motion to manage
- Hides defects (found later)
- Consumes resources unnecessarily

### Examples

**Manufacturing**:
- Large batch production
- Just-in-case inventory
- Making to forecast vs. demand

**Service/Office**:
- Printing reports nobody reads
- CC'ing everyone on emails
- Creating unused documentation

**Healthcare**:
- Unnecessary tests
- Over-documentation
- Duplicate records

**IT/Software**:
- Features nobody uses
- Over-engineered solutions
- Building ahead of need

### Root Causes
- Push systems (vs. pull)
- Large batch mentality
- Fear of stockouts
- Unleveled scheduling
- Long changeover times

### Solutions
- Pull systems (Kanban)
- One-piece flow
- Takt time production
- Heijunka (leveling)
- Reduce setup times

### Solutions
- Line balancing
- TPM (Total Productive Maintenance)
- Cross-training
- Parallel processing
- Pre-staging

- Knowledge not captured
- Innovation lost

### Root Causes
- Command-and-control culture
- Lack of trust
- No systems for input

- Poor communication

### Solutions
- Suggestion systems
- Kaizen involvement
- Cross-functional teams
- Skill development programs
- Empowerment and delegation

---

## T - Transportation

### Definition
Unnecessary movement of materials, products, or information.

### Examples

**Manufacturing**:
- Moving WIP between buildings

- Excess material handling

**Service/Office**:
- Moving files between departments
- Routing documents for signatures
- Walking to fax/printer

**Healthcare**:
- Patient transfers
- Sample transportation
- Supply movement

**IT/Software**:
- Data transfers between systems
- Manual handoffs
- Moving work items between tools

### Root Causes
- Poor facility layout
- Large batch production
- Departmental silos
- Disconnected processes
- Central vs. point-of-use storage

### Solutions
- Cellular layout
- Point-of-use storage
- Co-locate related functions
- Reduce batch sizes
- Integrate systems

---

## I - Inventory

### Definition
Excess raw materials, work-in-process, or finished goods beyond immediate need.

### Examples

**Manufacturing**:
- Excessive safety stock
- Large WIP buffers
- Obsolete inventory

**Service/Office**:
- Backlog of work
- Unread emails
- Pending approvals

**Healthcare**:
- Expired supplies
- Overstocked medications
- Excess equipment

**IT/Software**:
- Unfinished features
- Documentation backlog
- Incomplete projects

### Hidden Costs
- Storage space
- Handling labor
- Obsolescence risk
- Quality degradation
- Capital tied up
- Hides problems

### Root Causes
- Overproduction
- Poor forecasting
- Long lead times
- Unreliable suppliers
- Large batch sizes

### Solutions
- Pull systems
- Reduce batch sizes
- Improve reliability
- Better forecasting
- Supplier development

## M - Motion

### Definition
Unnecessary movement of people that doesn't add value.

### Examples

**Manufacturing**:
- Walking to get tools

## Identifying Waste

### Waste Walk

A structured observation activity:

1. **Plan the walk**
   - Define process to observe
   - Prepare observation sheet
   - Schedule appropriate time

2. **Observe**
   - Watch without interrupting
   - Note each waste category
   - Quantify where possible

3. **Document**
   - List specific wastes
   - Photograph examples
   - Estimate impact

4. **Analyze**
   - Prioritize by impact
   - Identify root causes
   - Develop countermeasures

### Waste Observation Sheet

| Time | Activity | Value Added? | Waste Type | Notes |
|------|----------|--------------|------------|-------|
| 9:00 | Search for tool | No | Motion | 2 min |
| 9:02 | Setup machine | Partial | Extra-proc | 5 min |
| 9:07 | Produce part | Yes | - | 30 sec |

## Prioritizing Waste Elimination

### Impact vs. Effort Matrix

```
              Low Effort         High Effort
           ┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
High       │   DO FIRST      │   PLAN FOR      │
Impact     │   Quick wins    │   Major projects│
           ├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
Low        │   DO IF TIME    │   DON'T BOTHER  │
Impact     │   Fill-ins      │   Low priority  │
           └─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

### Elimination Priority
1. Overproduction (causes other wastes)
2. Defects (direct cost)
3. Waiting (opportunity cost)
4. Extra-processing
5. Motion
6. Transportation
7. Inventory
8. Non-utilized talent
